SECTION 00 05 01                                  
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR WORK WITHIN A VA HOSPITAL

1.	GENERAL:

A.  This section is to bring to the attention of the contractor, Special Requirements of our hospital.  Our primary goal is to provide safe, accurate, comfortable treatment and diagnostic work.  The construction project is secondary.  The prints may show phasing but cannot convey every consideration that must be given to implement the plan.  Close coordination and advance notifications must be provided.  The VA cannot tolerate the method of construction as would be done in an empty building for example.  Therefore, the contractor shall plan for cleanliness, dust proofing, quietness, etc., as needed.

The following are considerations and requirements needed in order to work at the hospital.

B.  Requirements:
INFECTION CONTROL PROCEDURES
TO BE APPLIED TO ALL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS

1.	The overriding principal is to work within an area that is under negative pressure and contain all dust within the construction area.  The contractor must whatever is necessary in order to achieve this.
In order to accomplish the above, the CUBE method will be used.  This method demands that a CUBE consisting of the floor, walls both above and below suspended ceilings and the deck above be established and maintained while construction is being performed.  Walls may have to be built by the contractor if the existing walls cannot be utilized.  The CUBE will be kept under negative pressure.  In addition to containing dust within the work area, dust must be kept from exiting the work area via footsteps and cart wheels.
The project will have an ICRA (Infection Control Risk Assessment) completed prior to any construction or phase of construction.  This document will be posted and maintained at the construction site and serve as reminder of the precautions to be followed.  The ICRA will address the following:

ICRA
•	To be posted before any work is done and reviewed at each phase for any adjustment needed.
•	To be initiated by IC (Infection Control department) or Engineering and signed off by both parties.
•	ICRA forms will be kept by Safety and IC.
Infection Control briefing
•	An overview of infection control will be given at the preconstruction conference.
•	Superintendant will be required to attend the preconstruction conference.
Barrier plan
•	Contractor will sketch out the placements of his barrier(s) and get approval by IC via the COTR.
•	Barrier will be inspected by IC before each phase is started.
•	Hard wall (drywall and metal studs) barriers will be used for work lasting longer than 24 hours.  Tape and floating will not be needed.  Joints will be covered with blue painters tape including attachment at walls, floors and ceilings.
•	Plastic (fire-resistive) can be used for work lasting 24 hours or less on barriers below ceilings.  Plastic may be used for periods exceeding 24 hours above ceilings.
•	The contractor may use the VA’s Curtain-Wall system utilizing his own plastic.
•	Barrier must also serve as physical barrier for when the area is not occupied by contactors.  Entry will be via an actual door and frame and will be locked when not occupied.
Negative Air
•	Existing ceilings may be used as part of the CUBE barrier.
•	Minus .03 inches of water pressure must be maintained.  The contractor is responsible for providing negative air unit(s) as needed to maintain .03 inches of pressure.  Contractor must install a manometer with a scale of 0-1/2 inch water for each pressure area.
•	Discharge into a corridor via a grill.  The VA must prove that air discharged is clean (HEPA) via a particle meter before the unit is turned on and any work started.
Mats
•	Carpet shall not be used.  Contractor must clean his wheels and feet in the anteroom so that no dust is tracked down the hall.
•	Sticky mats will be used in class 3 and 4 construction and will be changed every 4 hours.
Anteroom
•	Serves as an air lock and a place to remove dust from people, carts, feet, etc.
•	Can be built inside the construction area or if built in the corridor, 5 feet clearance must be maintained.
•	Must be hard walls.
•	Air flow will be from the outside common space into the anteroom and then into the construction area.
Gross demolition
•	Tyvek coveralls and disposable shoe covers must be worn during gross demolition phase which is defined as wall, ceiling and flooring removal.
•	Use covered carts or containers when transporting waste down approved routes.
•	Disposable items are to be used one time.
•	Must be removed in the ante room before leaving the work area.
Existing HVAC Grills
•	Must seal all grills – supply, return, and exhaust.
•	Seal by substantial method to prevent barrier from coming loose.  Use blue painter tape only and do not use duct tape anywhere.
Above Ceiling Inspections – as part of work planning
•	Allowed to remove one tile per 50 square feet for inspection with no IC control.
•	No work will be allowed without IC control with the exception of allowing cable pulling which may be done with the CUBE method.
Fire or Smoke barriers
•	Temporary barriers must be built to give the same rating through an alternate path when existing barriers must be compromised.
•	Permanent new rated walls and ceilings (as needed) will be built before existing rated barriers are compromised.

General
•	Clean the work area daily to control the amount of accumulated dust from collecting within the work area.
•	Ceiling T-grids must be vacuumed before tile is placed.
•	Utility runs that don’t necessarily have work contained to a room will still have to confirm to the CUBE method.  A plastic barrier will have to be placed over the location of a utility run and secured to the remaining ceiling in conjunction with existing walls and / or barrier walls.
2.  Telephone and Computer Wiring:

All telephone and computer jacks shall be removed by the VA as needed.  At the pre-construction walkthrough, the contractor shall discuss timeframes for removal with the COTR (Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative) who will contact the VA’s telecommunications group for actual removal.  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL NOT ATTEMPT ANY REMOVAL INCLUDING THE UNPLUGGING OF PHONES AND COMPUTERS.

3.  The Fire Alarm devices – smoke detectors, heat detectors and pull stations, are all addressed devices.  Do not remove any of these devices.  If they must be removed, please contact the COTR.

4.  Penetrations through floors and rated walls must be fire-stopped with materials made from the specific application at hand.  Sealing must be done at the time the penetration is made and not done at the end of the job.

5.  No temporary or permanent wireless access point or WIFI will be set up inside or outside any VA Building.

C. Materials to be turned over for maintenance stock:

1.  The contractor will turn over no less than 3% of each product used for station stock.  

2. Materials to be turned over is limited to flooring (roll carpet is not needed) and specialty ceiling tile.  Turn over material in original containers.

D. Electric Outlets and Data Jacks:

1.  Every job results in the need for additional electric and data jacks needed.  The contractor will include in his price, work to install electric outlets and data jacks as directed.  

2. The outlets and jacks will be required at the very end of the project.  The VA will survey the new space with the users and will give a list of where any are needed.

3. The Contractor shall provide one duplex outlet (either normal or emergency power) and one triplex data jack per 1000 gross square feet (rounded) of new or renovated built.

4. The VA will be entitled to a credit for any unneeded devices not installed.  Conversely, the VA will pay for any additional needed.

E.  Other Areas of Concern:

1.  When construction is near sensitive areas such as surgery, noisy operations shall be discontinued until a more appropriate time, which may be after normal working hours or on weekends.  If this has been determined, it shall be accomplished at no additional cost to the VA.

2.  The contractor shall notify the COTR in advance of operations that would cause disruption to the operation of the medical center.  Examples of these disruptions are:  utility shutdown, noise, vibration, etc.  The contractor shall adjust his schedule to accommodate patient care activities.

3.  Utilities shall not be disconnected without coordination with the COTR.  Contractors have often cut power to "their" area and ended up cutting off power to areas outside the construction site.

4.  Contractor shall not attempt to work an electric circuit hot.  If necessary, a temporary electric feed will be run.

5.  Odors may cause problems such as painting with oil-based paint on a patient ward.  Reasonable action such as putting an exhaust fan in a window or hanging plastic to isolate a painted area shall be needed.

B.	The Contractor shall submit the following supporting data in addition to the project schedule: 
1.	The appropriate project calendar including working days and holidays. 
2.	The planned number of shifts per day. 
3.	The number of hours per shift.  
Failure of the Contractor to include this data shall delay the review of the submittal until the Contracting Officer is in receipt of the missing data. 
C.	To the extent that the Project Schedule or any revised Project Schedule shows anything not jointly agreed upon, it shall not be deemed to have been approved by the COR. Failure to include any element of work required for the performance of this contract shall not excuse the Contractor from completing all work required within any applicable completion date of each phase regardless of the COR’s approval of the Project Schedule. 
D.	Compact Disk Requirements and CPM Activity/Event Record Specifications: Submit to the VA an electronic file(s) containing one file of the data required to produce a schedule, reflecting all the activities/events of the complete project schedule being submitted.
1.8 PAYMENT TO THE CONTRACTOR:
A.	Monthly, the contractor shall submit an application and certificate for payment using // VA Form 10-6001a // or //the AIA application and certificate for payment documents G702 & G703 // reflecting updated schedule activities and cost data in accordance with the provisions of the following Article, PAYMENT AND PROGRESS REPORTING, as the basis upon which progress payments will be made pursuant to Article, FAR 52.232 – 5 (PAYMENT UNDER FIXED-PRICE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS) and VAAR 852.236 – 83 (PAYMENT UNDER FIXED-PRICE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS). The Contractor shall be entitled to a monthly progress payment upon approval of estimates as determined from the currently approved updated project schedule. Monthly payment requests shall include: a listing of all agreed upon project schedule changes and associated data; and an electronic file (s) of the resulting monthly updated schedule.
B.	Approval of the Contractor’s monthly Application for Payment shall be contingent, among other factors, on the submittal of a satisfactory monthly update of the project schedule.
1.9 PAYMENT AND PROGRESS REPORTING
A.	Monthly schedule update meetings will be held on dates mutually agreed to by the COR and the Contractor. Contractor and their CPM consultant (if applicable) shall attend all monthly schedule update meetings. The Contractor shall accurately update the Project Schedule and all other data required and provide this information to the COR three work days in advance of the schedule update meeting. Job progress will be reviewed to verify:
1.	Actual start and/or finish dates for updated/completed activities/events.
2.	Remaining duration for each activity/event started, or scheduled to start, but not completed.
3.	Logic, time and cost data for change orders, and supplemental agreements that are to be incorporated into the Project Schedule.
4. Changes in activity/event sequence and/or duration which have been made, pursuant to the provisions of following Article, ADJUSTMENT OF CONTRACT COMPLETION.
5.	Completion percentage for all completed and partially completed activities/events.
6.	Logic and duration revisions required by this section of the specifications.
7.	Activity/event duration and percent complete shall be updated independently.
B.	After completion of the joint review, the contractor shall generate an updated computer-produced calendar-dated schedule and supply the Contracting Officer’s representative with reports in accordance with the Article, COMPUTER PRODUCED SCHEDULES, specified.
C.	After completing the monthly schedule update, the contractor’s representative or scheduling consultant shall rerun all current period contract change(s) against the prior approved monthly project schedule. The analysis shall only include original workday durations and schedule logic agreed upon by the contractor and resident engineer for the contract change(s). When there is a disagreement on logic and/or durations, the Contractor shall use the schedule logic and/or durations provided and approved by the resident engineer. After each rerun update, the resulting electronic project schedule data file shall be appropriately identified and submitted to the VA in accordance to the requirements listed in articles 1.4 and 1.7. This electronic submission is separate from the regular monthly project schedule update requirements and shall be submitted to the resident engineer within fourteen (14) calendar days of completing the regular schedule update. Before inserting the contract changes durations, care must be taken to ensure that only the original durations will be used for the analysis, not the reported durations after progress.  In addition, once the final network diagram is approved, the contractor must recreate all manual progress payment updates on this approved network diagram and associated reruns for contract changes in each of these update periods as outlined above for regular update periods.  This will require detailed record keeping for each of the manual progress payment updates.
D.	Following approval of the CPM schedule, the VA, the General Contractor, its approved CPM Consultant, RE office representatives, and all subcontractors needed, as determined by the SRE, shall meet to discuss the monthly updated schedule. The main emphasis shall be to address work activities to avoid slippage of project schedule and to identify any necessary actions required to maintain project schedule during the reporting period. The Government representatives and the Contractor should conclude the meeting with a clear understanding of those work and administrative actions necessary to maintain project schedule status during the reporting period. This schedule coordination meeting will occur after each monthly project schedule update meeting utilizing the resulting schedule reports from that schedule update. If the project is behind schedule, discussions should include ways to prevent further slippage as well as ways to improve the project schedule status, when appropriate.
1.10 RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPLETION
A.	If it becomes apparent from the current revised monthly progress schedule that phasing or contract completion dates will not be met, the Contractor shall execute some or all of the following remedial actions: 
1.	Increase construction manpower in such quantities and crafts as necessary to eliminate the backlog of work.
2.	Increase the number of working hours per shift, shifts per working day, working days per week, the amount of construction equipment, or any combination of the foregoing to eliminate the backlog of work. 
3.	Reschedule the work in conformance with the specification requirements.
B.	Prior to proceeding with any of the above actions, the Contractor shall notify and obtain approval from the COR for the proposed schedule changes. If such actions are approved, the representative schedule revisions shall be incorporated by the Contractor into the Project Schedule before the next update, at no additional cost to the Government.
1.11 CHANGES TO THE SCHEDULE
A.	Within 30 calendar days after VA acceptance and approval of any updated project schedule, the Contractor shall submit a revised electronic file (s) and a list of any activity/event changes including predecessors and successors for any of the following reasons:
1.	Delay in completion of any activity/event or group of activities/events, which may be involved with contract changes, strikes, unusual weather, and other delays will not relieve the Contractor from the requirements specified unless the conditions are shown on the CPM as the direct cause for delaying the project beyond the acceptable limits.
2.	Delays in submittals, or deliveries, or work stoppage are encountered which make rescheduling of the work necessary.
3.	The schedule does not represent the actual prosecution and progress of the project.
4.	When there is, or has been, a substantial revision to the activity/event costs regardless of the cause for these revisions.
B.	CPM revisions made under this paragraph which affect the previously approved computer produced schedules for Government furnished equipment, vacating of areas by the VA Facility, contract phase(s) and sub phase(s), utilities furnished by the Government to the Contractor, or any other previously contracted item, shall be furnished in writing to the Contracting Officer for approval.
C.	Contracting Officer's approval for the revised project schedule and all relevant data is contingent upon compliance with all other paragraphs of this section and any other previous agreements by the Contracting Officer or the VA representative.
D.	The cost of revisions to the project schedule resulting from contract changes will be included in the proposal for changes in work as specified in FAR 52.243 – 4 (Changes) and VAAR 852.236 – 88 (Changes – Supplemental), and will be based on the complexity of the revision or contract change, man hours expended in analyzing the change, and the total cost of the change. 
E.	The cost of revisions to the Project Schedule not resulting from contract changes is the responsibility of the Contractor.
1.12 ADJUSTMENT OF CONTRACT COMPLETION
A.	The contract completion time will be adjusted only for causes specified in this contract. Request for an extension of the contract completion date by the Contractor shall be supported with a justification, CPM data and supporting evidence as the COR may deem necessary for determination as to whether or not the Contractor is entitled to an extension of time under the provisions of the contract. Submission of proof based on revised activity/event logic, durations (in work days) and costs is obligatory to any approvals. The schedule must clearly display that the Contractor has used, in full, all the float time available for the work involved in this request. The Contracting Officer's determination as to the total number of days of contract extension will be based upon the current computer produced calendar dated schedule for the time period in question and all other relevant information.
B.	Actual delays in activities/events which, according to the computer  produced calendar dated schedule, do not affect the extended and predicted contract completion dates shown by the critical path in the network, will not be the basis for a change to the contract completion date. The Contracting Officer will within a reasonable time after receipt of such justification and supporting evidence, review the facts and advise the Contractor in writing of the Contracting Officer's decision.
C.	The Contractor shall submit each request for a change in the contract completion date to the Contracting Officer in accordance with the provisions specified under FAR 52.243 – 4 (Changes) and VAAR 852.236 – 88 (Changes – Supplemental). The Contractor shall include, as a part of each change order proposal, a sketch showing all CPM logic revisions, duration (in work days) changes, and cost changes, for work in question and its relationship to other activities on the approved network diagram.
D.	All delays due to non-work activities/events such as RFI’s, WEATHER, STRIKES, and similar non-work activities/events shall be analyzed on a month by month basis.

SECTION 01 91 00
GENERAL COMMISSIONING REQUIREMENTS
PART 1 - GENERAL
1.1 COMMISSIONING DESCRIPTION
A.	This Section 01 91 00 GENERAL COMMISSIONING REQUIREMENTS shall form the basis of the construction phase commissioning process and procedures.  The Commissioning Agent shall add, modify, and refine the commissioning procedures, as approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to suit field conditions and actual manufacturer's equipment, incorporate test data and procedure results, and provide detailed scheduling for all commissioning tasks.
B.	Various sections of the project specifications require equipment startup, testing, and adjusting services. Requirements for startup, testing, and adjusting services specified in the Division 7, Division 21, Division 22, Division 23, Division 26, Division 27, Division 28, and Division 31 series sections of these specifications are intended to be provided in coordination with the commissioning services and are not intended to duplicate services. The Contractor shall coordinate the work required by individual specification sections with the commissioning services requirements specified herein. 
C.	Where individual testing, adjusting, or related services are required in the project specifications and not specifically required by this commissioning requirements specification, the specified services shall be provided and copies of documentation, as required by those specifications shall be submitted to the VA and the Commissioning Agent to be indexed for future reference. 
D.	Where training or educational services for VA are required and specified in other sections of the specifications, including but not limited to Division 7, Division 8, Division 21, Division 22, Division 23, Division 26, Division 27, Division 28, and Division 31 series sections of the specification, these services are intended to be provided in addition to the training and educational services specified herein.
E.	Commissioning is a systematic process of verifying that the building systems perform interactively according to the construction documents and the VA’s operational needs. The commissioning process shall encompass and coordinate the system documentation, equipment startup, control system calibration, testing and balancing, performance testing and training. Commissioning during the construction and post-occupancy phases is intended to achieve the following specific objectives according to the contract documents:
1.	Verify that the applicable equipment and systems are installed in accordance with the contact documents and according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
2.	Verify and document proper integrated performance of equipment and systems.
3.	Verify that Operations & Maintenance documentation is complete.
4.	Verify that all components requiring servicing can be accessed, serviced and removed without disturbing nearby components including ducts, piping, cabling or wiring.
5.	Verify that the VA’s operating personnel are adequately trained to enable them to operate, monitor, adjust, maintain, and repair building systems in an effective and energy-efficient manner.
6.	Document the successful achievement of the commissioning objectives listed above.
F.	The commissioning process does not take away from or reduce the responsibility of the Contractor to provide a finished and fully functioning product.
1.2 CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS
A.	For this construction project, the Department of Veterans Affairs contracts with a Contractor to provide construction services.  The contracts are administered by the VA Contracting Officer and the COR as the designated representative of the Contracting Officer.  On this project, the authority to modify the contract in any way is strictly limited to the authority of the Contracting Officer.  
B.	In this project, only two contract parties are recognized and communications on contractual issues are strictly limited to VA COR and the Contractor.  It is the practice of the VA to require that communications between other parties to the contracts (Subcontractors and Vendors) be conducted through the COR and Contractor.  It is also the practice of the VA that communications between other parties of the project (Commissioning Agent and Architect/Engineer) be conducted through the COR.  
C.	Whole Building Commissioning is a process that relies upon frequent and direct communications, as well as collaboration between all parties to the construction process.  By its nature, a high level of communication and cooperation between the Commissioning Agent and all other parties (Architects, Engineers, Subcontractors, Vendors, third party testing agencies, etc.) is essential to the success of the Commissioning effort.  
D.	With these fundamental practices in mind, the commissioning process described herein has been developed to recognize that, in the execution of the Commissioning Process, the Commissioning Agent must develop effective methods to communicate with every member of the construction team involved in delivering commissioned systems while simultaneously respecting the exclusive contract authority of the Contracting Officer and COR.   Thus, the procedures outlined in this specification must be executed within the following limitations:
1.	No communications (verbal or written) from the Commissioning Agent shall be deemed to constitute direction that modifies the terms of any contract between the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Contractor.
2.	Commissioning Issues identified by the Commissioning Agent will be delivered to the COR and copied to the designated Commissioning Representatives for the Contractor and subcontractors on the Commissioning Team for information only in order to expedite the communication process.  These issues must be understood as the professional opinion of the Commissioning Agent and as suggestions for resolution.  
3.	In the event that any Commissioning Issues and suggested resolutions are deemed by the COR to require either an official interpretation of the construction documents or require a modification of the contract documents, the Contracting Officer or COR will issue an official directive to this effect.
4.	All parties to the Commissioning Process shall be individually responsible for alerting the COR of any issues that they deem to constitute a potential contract change prior to acting on these issues. 
5.	Authority for resolution or modification of design and construction issues rests solely with the Contracting Officer or COR, with appropriate technical guidance from the Architect/Engineer and/or Commissioning Agent.

3.2 STARTUP, INITIAL CHECKOUT, AND PRE-FUNCTIONAL CHECKLISTS 
A.	The following procedures shall apply to all equipment and systems to be commissioned, according to Part 1, Systems to Be Commissioned.
1.	Pre-Functional Checklists are important to ensure that the equipment and systems are hooked up and operational. These ensure that Systems Functional Performance Testing may proceed without unnecessary delays. Each system to be commissioned shall have a full Pre-Functional Checklist completed by the Contractor prior to Systems Functional Performance Testing. No sampling strategies are used. 
a.	The Pre-Functional Checklist will identify the trades responsible for completing the checklist.  The Contractor shall ensure the appropriate trades complete the checklists.
b.	The Commissioning Agent will review completed Pre-Functional Checklists and field-verify the accuracy of the completed checklist using sampling techniques.  
2.	Startup and Initial Checkout Plan:  The Contractor shall develop detailed startup plans for all equipment. The primary role of the Contractor in this process is to ensure that there is written documentation that each of the manufacturer recommended procedures have been completed. Parties responsible for startup shall be identified in the Startup Plan and in the checklist forms.
a.	The Contractor shall develop the full startup plan by combining (or adding to) the checklists with the manufacturer's detailed startup and checkout procedures from the O&M manual data and the field checkout sheets normally used by the Contractor. The plan shall include checklists and procedures with specific boxes or lines for recording and documenting the checking and inspections of each procedure and a summary statement with a signature block at the end of the plan.
b.	The full startup plan shall at a minimum consist of the following items:
1)	The Pre-Functional Checklists.
2)	The manufacturer's standard written startup procedures copied from the installation manuals with check boxes by each procedure and a signature block added by hand at the end.
3)	The manufacturer's normally used field checkout sheets.
c.	The Commissioning Agent will submit the full startup plan to the VA and Contractor for review.  Final approval will be by the VA. 
d.	The Contractor shall review and evaluate the procedures and the format for documenting them, noting any procedures that need to be revised or added.
3.	Sensor and Actuator Calibration
a.	All field installed temperature, relative humidity, CO2 and pressure sensors and gages, and all actuators (dampers and valves) on all equipment shall be calibrated using the methods described in Division 21, Division 22, Division 23, Division 26, Division 27, and Division 28 specifications.
b.	All procedures used shall be fully documented on the Pre-Functional Checklists or other suitable forms, clearly referencing the procedures followed and written documentation of initial, intermediate and final results.
4.	Execution of Equipment Startup

a.	//Four// //insert number// weeks prior to equipment startup, the Contractor shall schedule startup and checkout with the VA and Commissioning Agent. The performance of the startup and checkout shall be directed and executed by the Contractor.
b.	The Commissioning Agent will observe the startup procedures for selected pieces of primary equipment.
c.	The Contractor shall execute startup and provide the VA and Commissioning Agent with a signed and dated copy of the completed startup checklists, and contractor tests.
d.	Only individuals that have direct knowledge and witnessed that a line item task on the Startup Checklist was actually performed shall initial or check that item off. It is not acceptable for witnessing supervisors to fill out these forms.
3.3 DEFICIENCIES, NONCONFORMANCE, AND APPROVAL IN CHECKLISTS AND STARTUP 
A.	The Contractor shall clearly list any outstanding items of the initial startup and Pre-Functional Checklist procedures that were not completed successfully, at the bottom of the procedures form or on an attached sheet. The procedures form and any outstanding deficiencies shall be provided to the VA and the Commissioning Agent within two days of completion.
B.	The Commissioning Agent will review the report and submit comments to the VA. The Commissioning Agent will work with the Contractor to correct and verify deficiencies or uncompleted items. The Commissioning Agent will involve the VA and others as necessary. The Contractor shall correct all areas that are noncompliant or incomplete in the checklists in a timely manner, and shall notify the VA and Commissioning Agent as soon as outstanding items have been corrected.  The Contractor shall submit an updated startup report and a Statement of Correction on the original noncompliance report. When satisfactorily completed, the Commissioning Agent will recommend approval of the checklists and startup of each system to the VA. 
C.	The Contractor shall be responsible for resolution of deficiencies as directed the VA. 

3.4 PHASED COMMISSIONING
A.	The project may require startup and initial checkout to be executed in phases. This phasing shall be planned and scheduled in a coordination meeting of the VA, Commissioning Agent, and the Contractor. Results will be added to the master construction schedule and the commissioning schedule.
3.5 DDC SYSTEM TRENDING FOR COMMISSIONING
A.	Trending is a method of testing as a standalone method or to augment manual testing. The Contractor shall trend any and all points of the system or systems at intervals specified below. 
B.	Alarms are a means to notify the system operator that abnormal conditions are present in the system.  Alarms shall be structured into three tiers – Critical, Priority, and Maintenance.
1.	Critical alarms are intended to be alarms that require the immediate attention of and action by the Operator.  These alarms shall be displayed on the Operator Workstation in a popup style window that is graphically linked to the associated unit's graphical display.  The popup style window shall be displayed on top of any active window within the screen, including non DDC system software.
2.	Priority level alarms are to be printed to a printer which is connected to the Operator’s Work Station located within the engineer’s office.  Additionally Priority level alarms shall be able to be monitored and viewed through an active alarm application.  Priority level alarms are alarms which shall require reaction from the operator or maintenance personnel within a normal work shift, and not immediate action.  
3.	Maintenance alarms are intended to be minor issues which would require examination by maintenance personnel within the following shift.  These alarms shall be generated in a scheduled report automatically by the DDC system at the start of each shift.  The generated maintenance report will be printed to a printer located within the engineer’s office.  
C.	The Contractor shall provide a wireless internet network in the building for use during controls programming, checkout, and commissioning. This network will allow project team members to more effectively program, view, manipulate and test control devices while being in the same room as the controlled device.
D.	The Contractor shall provide graphical trending through the DDC control system of systems being commissioned. Trending requirements are indicated below and included with the Systems Functional Performance Test Procedures. Trending shall occur before, during and after Systems Functional Performance Testing. The Contractor shall be responsible for producing graphical representations of the trended DDC points that show each system operating properly during steady state conditions as well as during the System Functional Testing. These graphical reports shall be submitted to the COR and Commissioning Agent for review and analysis before, during dynamic operation, and after Systems Functional Performance Testing. The Contractor shall provide, but not limited to, the following trend requirements and trend submissions:
1.	Pre-testing, Testing, and Post-testing – Trend reports of trend logs and graphical trend plots are required as defined by the Commissioning Agent. The trend log points, sampling rate, graphical plot configuration, and duration will be dictated by the Commissioning Agent. At any time during the Commissioning Process the Commissioning Agent may recommend changes to aspects of trending as deemed necessary for proper system analysis. The Contractor shall implement any changes as directed by the COR. Any pre-test trend analysis comments generated by the Commissioning Team should be addressed and resolved by the Contractor, as directed by the COR, prior to the execution of Systems Functional Performance Testing. 
2.	Dynamic plotting – The Contractor shall also provide dynamic plotting during Systems Functional Performance testing at frequent intervals for points determined by the Systems Functional Performance Test Procedure. The graphical plots will be formatted and plotted at durations listed in the Systems Functional Performance Test Procedure.
3.	Graphical plotting - The graphical plots shall be provided with a dual y-axis allowing 15 or more trend points (series) plotted simultaneously on the graph with each series in distinct color. The plots will further require title, axis naming, legend etc. all described by the Systems Functional Performance Test Procedure. If this cannot be sufficiently accomplished directly in the Direct Digital Control System then it is the responsibility of the Contractor to plot these trend logs in Microsoft Excel. 
4.	The following tables indicate the points to be trended and alarmed by system.  The Operational Trend Duration column indicates the trend duration for normal operations.  The Testing Trend Duration column indicates the trend duration prior to Systems Functional Performance Testing and again after Systems Functional Performance Testing.  The Type column indicates point type: AI = Analog Input, AO = Analog Output, DI = Digital Input, DO = Digital Output, Calc = Calculated Point.  In the Trend Interval Column, COV = Change of Value. The Alarm Type indicates the alarm priority; C = Critical, P = Priority, and M = Maintenance.  The Alarm Range column indicates when the point is considered in the alarm state.  The Alarm Delay column indicates the length of time the point must remain in an alarm state before the alarm is recorded in the DDC.  The intent is to allow minor, short-duration events to be corrected by the DDC system prior to recording an alarm.

3.6 SYSTEMS FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE TESTING
A.	This paragraph applies to Systems Functional Performance Testing of systems for all referenced specification Divisions.
B.	Objectives and Scope:  The objective of Systems Functional Performance Testing is to demonstrate that each system is operating according to the Contract Documents. Systems Functional Performance Testing facilitates bringing the systems from a state of substantial completion to full dynamic operation. Additionally, during the testing process, areas of noncompliant performance are identified and corrected, thereby improving the operation and functioning of the systems. In general, each system shall be operated through all modes of operation (seasonal, occupied, unoccupied, warm-up, cool-down, part- and full-load, fire alarm and emergency power) where there is a specified system response. The Contractor shall verify each sequence in the sequences of operation. Proper responses to such modes and conditions as power failure, freeze condition, low oil pressure, no flow, equipment failure, etc. shall also be tested.
C.	Development of Systems Functional Performance Test Procedures:  Before Systems Functional Performance Test procedures are written, the Contractor shall submit all requested documentation and a current list of change orders affecting equipment or systems, including an updated points list, program code, control sequences and parameters. Using the testing parameters and requirements found in the Contract Documents and approved submittals and shop drawings, the Commissioning Agent will develop specific Systems Functional Test Procedures to verify and document proper operation of each piece of equipment and system to be commissioned. The Contractor shall assist the Commissioning Agent in developing the Systems Functional Performance Test procedures as requested by the Commissioning Agent i.e. by answering questions about equipment, operation, sequences, etc.  Prior to execution, the Commissioning Agent will provide a copy of the Systems Functional Performance Test procedures to the VA, the Architect/Engineer, and the Contractor, who shall review the tests for feasibility, safety, equipment and warranty protection.
D.	Purpose of Test Procedures:  The purpose of each specific Systems Functional Performance Test is to verify and document compliance with the stated criteria of acceptance given on the test form. Representative test formats and examples are found in the Commissioning Plan for this project. (The Commissioning Plan is issued as a separate document and is available for review.)  The test procedure forms developed by the Commissioning Agent will include, but not be limited to, the following information:
1.	System and equipment or component name(s)
2.	Equipment location and ID number
3.	Unique test ID number, and reference to unique Pre-Functional Checklists and startup documentation, and ID numbers for the piece of equipment
4.	Date
5.	Project name
6.	Participating parties
7.	A copy of the specification section describing the test requirements
8.	A copy of the specific sequence of operations or other specified parameters being verified
9.	Formulas used in any calculations
10. Required pretest field measurements
11. Instructions for setting up the test.
12. Special cautions, alarm limits, etc.
13. Specific step-by-step procedures to execute the test, in a clear, sequential and repeatable format
14. Acceptance criteria of proper performance with a Yes / No check box to allow for clearly marking whether or not proper performance of each part of the test was achieved.
15. A section for comments.
16. Signatures and date block for the Commissioning Agent.  A place for the Contractor to initial to signify attendance at the test.
E.	Test Methods:  Systems Functional Performance Testing shall be achieved by manual testing (i.e. persons manipulate the equipment and observe performance) and/or by monitoring the performance and analyzing the results using the control system's trend log capabilities or by standalone data loggers. The Contractor and Commissioning Agent shall determine which method is most appropriate for tests that do not have a method specified.
1.	Simulated Conditions:  Simulating conditions (not by an overwritten value) shall be allowed, although timing the testing to experience actual conditions is encouraged wherever practical.
2.	Overwritten Values:  Overwriting sensor values to simulate a condition, such as overwriting the outside air temperature reading in a control system to be something other than it really is, shall be allowed, but shall be used with caution and avoided when possible. Such testing methods often can only test a part of a system, as the interactions and responses of other systems will be erroneous or not applicable. Simulating a condition is preferable. e.g., for the above case, by heating the outside air sensor with a hair blower rather than overwriting the value or by altering the appropriate setpoint to see the desired response. Before simulating conditions or overwriting values,	sensors, transducers and devices shall have been calibrated.
3.	Simulated Signals:  Using a signal generator which creates a simulated signal to test and calibrate transducers and DDC constants is generally recommended over using the sensor to act as the signal generator via simulated conditions or overwritten values.
4.	Altering Setpoints:  Rather than overwriting sensor values, and when simulating conditions is difficult, altering setpoints to test a sequence is acceptable. For example, to see the Air Conditioning compressor lockout initiate at an outside air temperature below 12 C (54 F), when the outside air temperature is above 12 C (54 F), temporarily change the lockout setpoint to be 2 C (4 F) above the current outside air temperature.
5.	Indirect Indicators:  Relying on indirect indicators for responses or performance shall be allowed only after visually and directly verifying and documenting, over the range of the tested parameters, that the indirect readings through the control system represent actual conditions and responses. Much of this verification shall be completed during systems startup and initial checkout.
F.	Setup:  Each function and test shall be performed under conditions that simulate actual conditions as closely as is practically possible. The Contractor shall provide all necessary materials, system modifications, etc. to produce the necessary flows, pressures, temperatures, etc. necessary to execute the test according to the specified conditions. At completion of the test, the Contractor shall return all affected building equipment and systems, due to these temporary modifications, to their pretest condition.
G.	Sampling:  No sampling is allowed in completing Pre-Functional Checklists.   Sampling is allowed for Systems Functional Performance Test Procedures execution.  The Commissioning Agent will determine the sampling rate.  If at any point, frequent failures are occurring and testing is becoming more troubleshooting than verification, the Commissioning Agent may stop the testing and require the Contractor to perform and document a checkout of the remaining units, prior to continuing with Systems Functional Performance Testing of the remaining units. 

Spec Writer Note:  Verify that the following paragraph regarding cost of expanded sample testing is allowed for the specific project.  Retain or delete the paragraph as necessary.

H.	Cost of Retesting:  The cost associated with expanded sample System Functional Performance Tests shall be solely the responsibility of the Contractor.  Any required retesting by the Contractor shall not be considered a justified reason for a claim of delay or for a time extension by the Contractor.
I.	Coordination and Scheduling:  The Contractor shall provide a minimum of 7 days’ notice to the Commissioning Agent and the VA regarding the completion schedule for the Pre-Functional Checklists and startup of all equipment and systems. The Commissioning Agent will schedule Systems Functional Performance Tests with the Contractor and VA. The Commissioning Agent will witness and document the Systems Functional Performance Testing of systems. The Contractor shall execute the tests in accordance with the Systems Functional Performance Test Procedure.
J.	Testing Prerequisites:  In general, Systems Functional Performance Testing will be conducted only after Pre-Functional Checklists have been satisfactorily completed. The control system shall be sufficiently tested and approved by the Commissioning Agent and the VA before it is used to verify performance of other components or systems. The air balancing and water balancing shall be completed before Systems Functional Performance Testing of air-related or water-related equipment or systems are scheduled. Systems Functional Performance Testing will proceed from components to subsystems to systems. When the proper performance of all interacting individual systems has been achieved, the interface or coordinated responses between systems will be checked.
K.	Problem Solving:  The Commissioning Agent will recommend solutions to problems found, however the burden of responsibility to solve, correct and retest problems is with the Contractor.
3.7 DOCUMENTATION, NONCONFORMANCE AND APPROVAL OF TESTS
A.	Documentation:  The Commissioning Agent will witness, and document the results of all Systems Functional Performance Tests using the specific procedural forms developed by the Commissioning Agent for that purpose. Prior to testing, the Commissioning Agent will provide these forms to the VA and the Contractor for review and approval. The Contractor shall include the filled out forms with the O&M manual data.
B.	Nonconformance:  The Commissioning Agent will record the results of the Systems Functional Performance Tests on the procedure or test form. All items of nonconformance issues will be noted and reported to the VA on Commissioning Field Reports and/or the Commissioning Master Issues Log.
1.	Corrections of minor items of noncompliance identified may be made during the tests. In such cases, the item of noncompliance and resolution shall be documented on the Systems Functional Test Procedure.
2.	Every effort shall be made to expedite the systems functional Performance Testing process and minimize unnecessary delays, while not compromising the integrity of the procedures. However, the Commissioning Agent shall not be pressured into overlooking noncompliant work or loosening acceptance criteria to satisfy scheduling or cost issues, unless there is an overriding reason to do so by direction from the VA.
3.	As the Systems Functional Performance Tests progresses and an item of noncompliance is identified, the Commissioning Agent shall discuss the issue with the Contractor and the VA.
4.	When there is no dispute on an item of noncompliance, and the Contractor accepts responsibility to correct it:
a.	The Commissioning Agent will document the item of noncompliance and the Contractor's response and/or intentions.  The Systems Functional Performance Test then continues or proceeds to another test or sequence. After the day's work is complete, the Commissioning Agent will submit a Commissioning Field Report to the VA.  The Commissioning Agent will also note items of noncompliance and the Contractor’s response in the Master Commissioning Issues Log.  The Contractor shall correct the item of noncompliance and report completion to the VA and the Commissioning Agent.  
b.	The need for retesting will be determined by the Commissioning Agent.  If retesting is required, the Commissioning Agent and the Contractor shall reschedule the test and the test shall be repeated.
5.	If there is a dispute about item of noncompliance, regarding whether it is an item of noncompliance, or who is responsible:
a.	The item of noncompliance shall be documented on the test form with the Contractor's response.  The item of noncompliance with the Contractor’s response shall also be reported on a Commissioning Field Report and on the Master Commissioning Issues Log.
b.	Resolutions shall be made at the lowest management level possible. Other parties are brought into the discussions as needed. Final interpretive and acceptance authority is with the Department of Veterans Affairs.
c.	The Commissioning Agent will document the resolution process.
d.	Once the interpretation and resolution have been decided, the Contractor shall correct the item of noncompliance, report it to the Commissioning Agent. The requirement for retesting will be determined by the Commissioning Agent.  If retesting is required, the Commissioning Agent and the Contractor shall reschedule the test.  Retesting shall be repeated until satisfactory performance is achieved.
C.	Cost of Retesting:  The cost to retest a System Functional Performance Test shall be solely the responsibility of the Contractor.  Any required retesting by the Contractor shall not be considered a justified reason for a claim of delay or for a time extension by the Contractor.
D.	Failure Due to Manufacturer Defect:  If 10%, or three, whichever is greater, of identical pieces (size alone does not constitute a difference) of equipment fail to perform in compliance with the Contract Documents (mechanically or substantively) due to manufacturing defect, not allowing it to meet its submitted performance specifications, all identical units may be considered unacceptable by the VA. In such case, the Contractor shall provide the VA with the following:
1.	Within one week of notification from the VA, the Contractor shall examine all other identical units making a record of the findings. The findings shall be provided to the VA within two weeks of the original notice.
2.	Within two weeks of the original notification, the Contractor shall provide a signed and dated, written explanation of the problem, cause of failures, etc. and all proposed solutions which shall include full equipment submittals. The proposed solutions shall not significantly exceed the specification requirements of the original installation.
3.	The VA shall determine whether a replacement of all identical units or a repair is acceptable.
4.	Two examples of the proposed solution shall be installed by the Contractor and the VA shall be allowed to test the installations for up to one week, upon which the VA will decide whether to accept the solution.
5.	Upon acceptance, the Contractor shall replace or repair all identical items, at their expense and extend the warranty accordingly, if the original equipment warranty had begun. The replacement/repair work shall proceed with reasonable speed beginning within one week from when parts can be obtained.
E.	Approval:  The Commissioning Agent will note each satisfactorily demonstrated function on the test form. Formal approval of the Systems Functional Performance Test shall be made later after review by the Commissioning Agent and by the VA. The Commissioning Agent will evaluate each test and report to the VA using a standard form. The VA will give final approval on each test using the same form, and provide signed copies to the Commissioning Agent and the Contractor.
3.8 DEFERRED TESTING
A.	Unforeseen Deferred Systems Functional Performance Tests:  If any Systems Functional Performance Test cannot be completed due to the building structure, required occupancy condition or other conditions, execution of the Systems Functional Performance Testing may be delayed upon approval of the VA. These Systems Functional Performance Tests shall be conducted in the same manner as the seasonal tests as soon as possible. Services of the Contractor to conduct these unforeseen Deferred Systems Functional Performance Tests shall be negotiated between the VA and the Contractor.
B.	Deferred Seasonal Testing:  Deferred Seasonal Systems Functional Performance Tests are those that must be deferred until weather conditions are closer to the systems design parameters.  The Commissioning Agent will review systems parameters and recommend which Systems Functional Performance Tests should be deferred until weather conditions more closely match systems parameters.  The Contractor shall review and comment on the proposed schedule for Deferred Seasonal Testing.  The VA will review and approve the schedule for Deferred Seasonal Testing.  Deferred Seasonal Systems Functional Performances Tests shall be witnessed and documented by the Commissioning Agent.  Deferred Seasonal Systems Functional Performance Tests shall be executed by the Contractor in accordance with these specifications.

4.	Discharge contents of tremies or flexible spouts in horizontal layers not exceeding 500 mm (20 inches) in thickness, and space tremies such as to provide a minimum of lateral movement of concrete.
5.	Continuously place concrete until an entire unit between construction joints is placed. Rate and method of placing concrete shall be such that no concrete between construction joints will be deposited upon or against partly set concrete, after its initial set has taken place, or after 45 minutes of elapsed time during concrete placement.
6.	On bottom of members with severe congestion of reinforcement, deposit 25 mm (1 inch) layer of flowing concrete containing the specified high-range water-reducing admixture (superplasticizer). Successive concrete lifts may be a continuation of this concrete or concrete with a conventional slump.
7.	Concrete on metal deck:
a.	Concrete on metal deck shall be minimum thickness shown. Allow for deflection of steel beams and metal deck under the weight of wet concrete in calculating concrete quantities for slab.
1)	The Contractor shall become familiar with deflection characteristics of structural frame to include proper amount of additional concrete due to beam/deck deflection.
E.	Consolidation: Conform to ACI 309. Immediately after depositing, spade concrete next to forms, work around reinforcement and into angles of forms, tamp lightly by hand, and compact with mechanical vibrator applied directly into concrete at approximately 450 mm (18 inch) intervals. Mechanical vibrator shall be power driven, hand operated type with minimum frequency of 5000 cycles per minute having an intensity sufficient to cause flow or settlement of concrete into place. Vibrate concrete to produce thorough compaction, complete embedment of reinforcement and concrete of uniform and maximum density without segregation of mix. Do not transport concrete in forms by vibration.
1.	Use of form vibration shall be approved only when concrete sections are too thin or too inaccessible for use of internal vibration.
2.	Carry on vibration continuously with placing of concrete. Do not insert vibrator into concrete that has begun to set.
3.8 HOT WEATHER:
	Follow the recommendations of ACI 305 or as specified to prevent problems in the manufacturing, placing, and curing of concrete that can adversely affect the properties and serviceability of the hardened concrete. Methods proposed for cooling materials and arrangements for protecting concrete shall be made in advance of concrete placement and approved by COR.
3.9 COLD WEATHER:
	Follow the recommendations of ACI 306 or as specified to prevent freezing of concrete and to permit concrete to gain strength properly. Use only the specified non-corrosive, non-chloride accelerator. Do not use calcium chloride, thiocyantes or admixtures containing more than 0.05 percent chloride ions. Methods proposed for heating materials and arrangements for protecting concrete shall be made in advance of concrete placement and approved by COR.
3.10 PROTECTION AND CURING:
A.	Conform to ACI 308: Initial curing shall immediately follow the finishing operation. Protect exposed surfaces of concrete from premature drying, wash by rain and running water, wind, mechanical injury, and excessively hot or cold temperatures. Keep concrete not covered with membrane or other curing material continuously wet for at least 7 days after placing, except wet curing period for high-early-strength concrete shall be not less than 3 days. Keep wood forms continuously wet to prevent moisture loss until forms are removed. Cure exposed concrete surfaces as described below. Other curing methods may be used if approved by COR.
1.	Liquid curing and sealing compounds: Apply by power-driven spray or roller in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Apply immediately after finishing. Maximum coverage 10m2/L (400 square feet per gallon) on steel troweled surfaces and 7.5m2/L  (300 square feet per gallon) on floated or broomed surfaces for the curing/sealing compound.
2.	Plastic sheets: Apply as soon as concrete has hardened sufficiently to prevent surface damage. Utilize widest practical width sheet and overlap adjacent sheets 50 mm (2 inches). Tightly seal joints with tape.
3.	Paper: Utilize widest practical width paper and overlap adjacent sheets 50 mm (2 inches). Tightly seal joints with sand, wood planks, pressure sensitive tape, mastic or glue.
3.11 REMOVAL OF FORMS:
A.	Remove in a manner to assure complete safety of structure after the following conditions have been met.
1.	Where structure as a whole is supported on shores, forms for beams and girder sides, columns, and similar vertical structural members may be removed after 24 hours, provided concrete has hardened sufficiently to prevent surface damage and curing is continued without any lapse in time as specified for exposed surfaces.
2.	Take particular care in removing forms of architectural exposed concrete to insure surfaces are not marred or gouged, and that corners and arises are true, sharp and unbroken.
B.	Control Test: Use to determine if the concrete has attained sufficient strength and curing to permit removal of supporting forms. Cylinders required for control tests taken in accordance with ASTM C172, molded in accordance with ASTM C31, and tested in accordance with ASTM C39. Control cylinders cured and protected in the same manner as the structure they represent. Supporting forms or shoring not removed until strength of control test cylinders have attained at least 70 percent of minimum 28 day compressive strength specified. Exercise care to assure that newly unsupported portions of structure are not subjected to heavy construction or material loading.
3.12 CONCRETE SURFACE PREPARATION:
A.	Metal Removal: Unnecessary metal items cut back flush with face of concrete members.
B.	Patching: Maintain curing and start patching as soon as forms are removed. Do not apply curing compounds to concrete surfaces requiring patching until patching is completed. Use cement mortar for patching of same composition as that used in concrete. Use white or gray Portland cement as necessary to obtain finish color matching surrounding concrete. Thoroughly clean areas to be patched. Cut out honeycombed or otherwise defective areas to solid concrete to a depth of not less than 25 mm (1 inch). Cut edge perpendicular to surface of concrete. Saturate with water area to be patched, and at least 150 mm (6 inches) surrounding before placing patching mortar. Give area to be patched a brush coat of cement grout followed immediately by patching mortar. Cement grout composed of one part Portland cement, 1.5 parts fine sand, bonding admixture, and water at a 50:50 ratio, mix to achieve consistency of thick paint. Mix patching mortar approximately 1 hour before placing and remix occasionally during this period without addition of water. Compact mortar into place and screed slightly higher than surrounding surface. After initial shrinkage has occurred, finish to match color and texture of adjoining surfaces.  Cure patches as specified for other concrete. Fill form tie holes which extend entirely through walls from unexposed face by means of a pressure gun or other suitable device to force mortar through wall. Wipe excess mortar off exposed face with a cloth.
C.	Upon removal of forms, clean vertical concrete surface that is to receive bonded applied cementitious application with wire brushes or by sand blasting to remove unset material, laitance, and loose particles to expose aggregates to provide a clean, firm, granular surface for bond of applied finish.

3.13 CONCRETE FINISHES:
A.	Vertical and Overhead Surface Finishes:
1.	Unfinished areas: Vertical and overhead concrete surfaces exposed in pipe basements, elevator and dumbwaiter shafts, pipe spaces, pipe trenches, above suspended ceilings, manholes, and other unfinished areas will not require additional finishing.
2.	Interior and exterior exposed areas to be painted: Remove fins, burrs and similar projections on surfaces flush, and smooth by mechanical means approved by COR, and by rubbing lightly with a fine abrasive stone or hone. Use ample water during rubbing without working up a lather of mortar or changing texture of concrete.
3.	Interior and exterior exposed areas finished: Give a grout finish of uniform color and smooth finish treated as follows:
a.	After concrete has hardened and laitance, fins and burrs removed, scrub concrete with wire brushes. Clean stained concrete surfaces by use of a hone stone.
b.	Apply grout composed of one part of Portland cement, one part fine sand, smaller than a 600 µm (No. 30) sieve. Work grout into surface of concrete with cork floats or fiber brushes until all pits, and honeycombs are filled.
c.	After grout has hardened slightly, but while still plastic, scrape grout off with a sponge rubber float and, about 1 hour later, rub concrete vigorously with burlap to remove any excess grout remaining on surfaces.
d.	In hot, dry weather use a fog spray to keep grout wet during setting period. Complete finish of area in same day. Make limits of finished areas at natural breaks in wall surface. Leave no grout on concrete surface overnight.
4.	Textured: Finish as specified. Maximum quantity of patched area 0.2 m2 (2 square feet) in each 93 m2 (1000 square feet) of textured surface.

B.	Slab Finishes:
1.	Monitoring and Adjustment: Provide continuous cycle of placement, measurement, evaluation and adjustment of procedures to produce slabs within specified tolerances. Monitor elevations of structural steel in key locations before and after concrete placement to establish typical deflection patterns for the structural steel. Determine elevations of cast-in-place slab soffits prior to removal of shores. Provide information to COR and floor consultant for evaluation and recommendations for subsequent placements.
2.	Set perimeter forms to serve as screed using either optical or laser instruments. For slabs on grade, wet screeds may be used to establish initial grade during strike-off, unless COR determines that the method is proving insufficient to meet required finish tolerances and directs use of rigid screed guides. Where wet screeds are allowed, they shall be placed using grade stakes set by optical or laser instruments. Use rigid screed guides, as opposed to wet screeds, to control strike-off elevation for all types of elevated (non slab-on-grade) slabs. Divide bays into halves or thirds by hard screeds. Adjust as necessary where monitoring of previous placements indicates unshored structural steel deflections to other than a level profile.
3.	Place slabs monolithically. Once slab placement commences, complete finishing operations within same day. Slope finished slab to floor drains where they occur, whether shown or not.
4.	Use straightedges specifically made for screeding, such as hollow magnesium straightedges or power strike-offs. Do not use pieces of dimensioned lumber. Strike off and screed slab to a true surface at required elevations. Use optical or laser instruments to check concrete finished surface grade after strike-off. Repeat strike-off as necessary. Complete screeding before any excess moisture or bleeding water is present on surface. Do not sprinkle dry cement on the surface.
5.	Immediately following screeding, and before any bleed water appears, use a 3000 mm (10 foot) wide highway straightedge in a cutting and filling operation to achieve surface flatness. Do not use bull floats or darbys, except that darbying may be allowed for narrow slabs and restricted spaces.
6.	Wait until water sheen disappears and surface stiffens before proceeding further. Do not perform subsequent operations until concrete will sustain foot pressure with maximum of 6 mm (1/4 inch) indentation.
7.	Scratch Finish: Finish base slab to receive a bonded applied cementitious application as indicated above, except that bull floats and darbys may be used. Thoroughly coarse wire broom within two hours after placing to roughen slab surface to insure a permanent bond between base slab and applied materials.
8.	Float Finish: Slabs to receive unbonded toppings, steel trowel finish, fill, mortar setting beds, or a built-up roof, and ramps, stair treads, platforms (interior and exterior), and equipment pads shall be floated to a smooth, dense uniform, sandy textured finish. During floating, while surface is still soft, check surface for flatness using a 3000 mm (10 foot) highway straightedge. Correct high spots by cutting down and correct low spots by filling in with material of same composition as floor finish. Remove any surface projections and re-float to a uniform texture.
9.	Steel Trowel Finish: Concrete surfaces to receive resilient floor covering or carpet, monolithic floor slabs to be exposed to view in finished work, future floor roof slabs, applied toppings, and other interior surfaces for which no other finish is indicated. Steel trowel immediately following floating. During final troweling, tilt steel trowel at a slight angle and exert heavy pressure to compact cement paste and form a dense, smooth surface. Finished surface shall be smooth, free of trowel marks, and uniform in texture and appearance.
10.	Broom Finish: Finish exterior slabs, ramps, and stair treads with a bristle brush moistened with clear water after surfaces have been floated. Brush in a direction transverse to main traffic. Match texture approved by COR from sample panel.
11.	Finished slab flatness (FF) and levelness (FL) values comply with the following minimum requirements:
a.	Areas covered with carpeting, or not specified otherwise in b. below:
1)	Slab on Grade:
a)	Specified overall value			FF 25/FL 20
b)	Minimum local value			FF 17/FL 15
2)	Level suspended slabs (shored until after testing) and topping slabs:
a)	Specified overall value			FF 25/FL 20
b)	Minimum local value			FF 17/FL 15
3)	Unshored suspended slabs:
a)	Specified overall value			FF 25
b)	Minimum local value			FF 17
4)	Level tolerance such that 80 percent of all points fall within a 20 mm (3/4 inch) envelope +10 mm, -10 mm (+3/8 inch, -3/8 inch) from the design elevation.
b.	Areas that will be exposed, receive thin-set tile or resilient flooring, or roof areas designed as future floors:
1)	Slab on grade:
a)	Specified overall value			FF 36/FL 20
b)	Minimum local value			FF 24/FL 15
2)	Level suspended slabs (shored until after testing) and topping slabs
a)	Specified overall value			FF 30/FL 20
b)	Minimum local value			FF 24/FL 15
3)	Unshored suspended slabs:
a)	Specified overall value			FF 30
b)	Minimum local value			FF 24
4)	Level tolerance such that 80 percent of all points fall within a 20 mm (3/4 inch) envelope +10 mm, -10 mm (+3/8 inch, -3/8 inch) from the design elevation.
c.	"Specified overall value" is based on the composite of all measured values in a placement derived in accordance with ASTM E1155.
d.	"Minimum local value" (MLV) describes the flatness or levelness below which repair or replacement is required. MLV is based on the results of an individual placement and applies to a minimum local area. Minimum local area boundaries may not cross a construction joint or expansion joint. A minimum local area will be bounded by construction and/or control joints, or by column lines and/or half-column lines, whichever is smaller.
12.	Measurements
a.	Department of Veterans Affairs retained testing laboratory will take measurements as directed by COR, to verify compliance with FF, FL, and other finish requirements. Measurements will occur within 72 hours after completion of concrete placement (weekends and holidays excluded). Make measurements before shores or forms are removed to insure the "as-built" levelness is accurately assessed. Profile data for above characteristics may be collected using a laser level or any Type II apparatus (ASTM E1155, "profileograph" or "dipstick"). Contractor's surveyor shall establish reference elevations to be used by Department of Veterans Affairs retained testing laboratory.
b.	Contractor not experienced in using FF and FL criteria is encouraged to retain the services of a floor consultant to assist with recommendations concerning adjustments to slab thicknesses, finishing techniques, and procedures on measurements of the finish as it progresses in order to achieve the specific flatness and levelness numbers.
13.	Acceptance/ Rejection:
a.	If individual slab section measures less than either of specified minimum local FF/FL numbers, that section shall be rejected and remedial measures shall be required. Sectional boundaries may be set at construction and contraction (control) joints, and not smaller than one-half bay.
b.	If composite value of entire slab installation, combination of all local results, measures less than either of specified overall FF/FL numbers, then whole slab shall be rejected and remedial measures shall be required.
14.	Remedial Measures for Rejected Slabs: Correct rejected slab areas by grinding, planing, surface repair with underlayment compound or repair topping, retopping, or removal and replacement of entire rejected slab areas, as directed by COR, until a slab finish constructed within specified tolerances is accepted.
3.14 SURFACE TREATMENTS:
A.	Use on exposed concrete floors and concrete floors to receive carpeting  except those specified to receive non-slip finish.
B.	Liquid Densifier/Sealer: Apply in accordance with manufacturer's directions just prior to completion of construction.
C.	Non-Slip Finish: Except where safety nosing and tread coverings are shown, apply non-slip abrasive aggregate to treads and platforms of concrete steps and stairs, and to surfaces of exterior concrete ramps and platforms. Broadcast aggregate uniformly over concrete surface at rate of application of 8% per 1/10th m2 (7.5 percent per square foot) of area. Trowel concrete surface to smooth dense finish. After curing, rub treated surface with abrasive brick and water to slightly expose abrasive aggregate.

1.	We have received the subject VACO MOU (signed copy attached), and are pleased to provide the following information and comments for your review that includes our risks and risk-mitigation factors that prompted our Facility’s decision:
a.	RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION:
(1)	Background:
(a)	(name) VAMC (here-in-after referred to as “the Facility”) has used (OEM Mdl Nr©)  for over 10 years to allow nurses in the telemetry studio to communicate with nurses at the patients’ bedside.  This communication medium is a vital patient safety tool that allows for rapid response to the development of a potentially fatal arrhythmia such as ventricular tachycardia.  The only information the telemetry technician states on the phone is “bed 109-2 Smith has an alarm for XXXXX.”  Last four is never communicated.  In terms of the pager we have limited the information on the pager to sector, bed number and last name.  We must include the last name as occasionally the patients are moved without the knowledge of the telemetry technician, if we were to have a patient mix up the page must contain the last name for safety reasons.  Facility Management Services (FMS) has restricted paging access to the telemetry system only.  Because pager access is restricted, only an administrator from Technology and Information Management (TIM) or FMS can troubleshoot a pager malfunction.
VAMC (City),  (State – ZIP Code), Unregulated FCC Equipment Use, Risk Assessment and Mitigation, Page Two
(b)	Because the phones are used 24X7 and have exceeded their life expectancy, many of them have begun to fail which creates a need to purchase newer models that will continue to insure system integrity.
(c)	Our Facility has been prevented from purchasing replacement phones because VACO now has updated security and Information Technology (IT) connection controls along with continuing FCC Part 15 restrictions (described in the attached MOU) on devices of which these wireless phones are but one example.  These updated security and connection controls are in place to address risks related life safety, information security, personal privacy and IT system integrity.  The FCC restrictions continue to warn against the use of “non-regulated radio / wireless based equipment in safety of life locations and functions.”  Of note, these controls are intended to prevent use of these devices in areas especially where a code-blue annunciation might occur, yet our devices have been used in such areas for over 10 years and so far has not prevented a code-blue annunciation from happening.
(d)	Because the Facility does not have a near-term alternative to the current wireless phones, it now faces a set of competing risks.  On the one hand are the risks of privacy, connection and interference or security breach(s) that are behind the controls in place for these devices.  On the other hand are risks to patient safety if the current phones were to fail and telemetry nurses would lose the ability to rapidly communicate with nurses at the bedside.  Our Facility does have a Life Safety approved Nurses Call / Code Blue hardwired system that is installed in those affected areas as the primary Code Blue Enunciation media.
(2)	SECURITY:
(a)	NEC provides a proprietary scrambling algorithm that is applied to handset registration / authentication and all communications.  Every time a (OEM Mdl Nr©) user enters a designated area within the systems’ coverage; an automatic user authentication process is performed to confirm the device is authorized for service on the system.  This information is scrambled using a proprietary coding scheme to prevent duplication.  All voice conversations are also scrambled to enhance security. 
(b)	The (OEM Mdl Nr©) has several built in security features in each of the wireless handsets are administered through the Facility’s Telephone Private Branch Exchange (PBX) administration tool; therefore, the PBX Administrator has full control over the (OEM Mdl Nr©)  wireless phones, if one gets lost or stolen it can be disabled immediately.  Because of this feature you cannot purchase a similar wireless phone and have it work on our network.  These phones have a 50 ft radius from the Zone radio frequency (RF) transceiver; they can only be used within the hospital as there is no handoff via other cellular networks.
(c)	These items are not NIST FIPS compliant; but based on the aforementioned facts, we feel patient / staff privacy and HIPAA instructions have been and will continue to be met. 
(d)	Our Facility will work with (OEM) and VACO’s Office of Cyber Security (Name and Phone Nr) to secure the appropriate NIST FIPS certifications will allow VA to issue a Official Approvals from the onset in the IT equipment / system procurement process.

(3)	RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) INTERFERENCE:
(a)	(OEM) engineers provided us with extensive information on the potential for RF along with electromagnetic (EM) interference to medical equipment within our Facility from the (OEM System) Wireless radio transceivers.
1)	Field Experience:  Since introduction of the (OEM System) Wireless product in 1996, NEC has installed this system at many health care institutions across the spectrum of medical departments.   In all this time there have been zero reports of either suspected or actual RF and EM interference.  This includes the experience using these devices at Portland VAMC and our continued testing documentation is available for review if requested.
2)	Potential interference called Near Field Coupling:   In these cases, an EM field emanating from one device may cause another device within its field area to malfunction.  Typically the distances for these fields are less than six (6) inches.  In attempts to mitigate these sources of interference, standards have been put in place, namely IEC 60601.  This standard calls for devices susceptible to interference to provide shielding against fields of up to three (3) Volts per Meter.   In contrast, the (OEM System) wireless products are classified under the FCC Part 15 rules as Class B unlicensed devices, and as such must meet very tight restrictions regarding field emissions of a maximum of from 100 to 500 micro (µ) Volts per Meter across the band of RFs from 30 Hz to 18 gHz.  Thus, any medical device even marginally meeting the IEC Standard has not had problems with any near field emissions.
3)	Potential phenomenon known as Far Field Induced RFI:  should be considered when studying RF and EM interference sources.  In this case, a part of the device subject to interference (e.g., a wire, probe, or the casing itself) can inadvertently act as a receiving antenna for a signal transmitted from another device within close proximity (within 6 to 18 inches, depending on the source power levels).  To realize this type of interference, the source transmitter power must be fairly strong to conduct through the inefficient nature of the unintended antenna of the receiving device, and the material acting as the antenna must be of a shape and length that matches or is a near multiple of the wavelength of the transmitted RF signal.  Finally, this unintentional antenna must not have the typical shielding between it and the subject device’s electronics, which if present would prevent such a received signal from causing interference. In the case of the (OEM System) Wireless transmission, which operates between 1,920 mHz and 1,930 mHz, a probe or such piece of any medical device measuring at about six (6) inches would match the wavelength of the RF carrier, and if not properly shielded from the units electronics may indeed conduct the RF energy within.  However, even in this case, one must consider the power level at the so-called antenna receiving the signal.  The average output of the (OEM Mdl Nr©) handset is approximately 10 mili (m) Watts when in use.  This very low power, even further reduced by the distance between any handset in use and the subject receiving equipment, considered along with the high loss of the “antenna”, results in a very low probability of actual interference.  These facts, along with the standard procedures of your engineering department’s efforts to check the medical equipment for such shielding and filtering defects, should mitigate this potential source.
4)	Potential interference between intentional radiators operating in the RF band. Known as either in-band or out-of-band interference, these are cases where a transmitter broadcasts a signal of significant power at the other device’s receiver to either overload the receiving radio or mix with the subject’s transmitted signal to cause an interfered signal to be received.  In-band interference 
VAMC (City),  (State – ZIP Code), Unregulated FCC Equipment Use, Risk Assessment and Mitigation, Page Four
in the Unlicensed PCS band of which the (OEM System) Wireless system operates is prevented by the FCC rules requiring our equipment to monitor the carrier on which a device intends to transmit on before doing so, so as to sense any current use by another device.  If such a signal is received during monitoring, we move to another carrier and try again. This protocol has been demonstrated many times within the FCC labs as well as at many industry trade shows where 5 or more vendors with U-PCS devices have operated in booths close to each other without interference.  As for out-of-band interference, because of the extremely low power our devices operate with and the very strict out-of-band emission requirements placed upon the U-PCS devices, and the additional factor of a wide separation in the operating frequencies of our system and the typical radio telemetry equipment used in many hospital environments, such interference is very remote and would require extremely close proximity of the two devices.
5)	All of our (OEM Mdl Nr©) are FCC listed and has not interfered with other traffic within the same band.  We expect the FCC listed (OEM Mdl Nr©) equipment will perform in the same manner.
(b)	Our Facility will work with (OEM) and VACO’s Spectrum Management (005OP2H3) to find a RF band that can be utilized for this operation that will allow VA to issue a formal and Official Radio Use Permit that will negate the “unregulated equipment use” issues. 
(4)	CONNECTION TO IT/CABLE NETWORKS:
(a)	Each item or system that attaches to a VA 	IT Network (telephone or data) must be Department of Commerce’s National Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) Underwriters Laboratory (UL) 60950-1/2; Information Technology Equipment - Safety listed and bears UL’s mark.
 1)	 Paragraph 1.1.1; Equipment Covered by this Standard specifically identifies these systems / networks as one affected system. 
2)	Paragraph 1.1.2; Additional Requirements further identifies this requirement for electomedical applications with physical connections to the patient be met.
(b)	This requirement is paramount since the Facility’s Telephone PABX and associated system is listed by the National Fire Protection Association as Critical Service.  Additionally, since it carries our Code Blue Radio and Overhead Audio Paging Signals, VA elevates it to Life Safety Service.
(c)	Presently the (OEM Mdl Nr©) wireless phones are UL Listed but does not have the aforementioned specific UL certification.  Our Facility is working with (The OEM) in this arena to have them meet or exceed this UL requirement.  In the meantime we will abide within the confines outlined in the attached MOU for insuring an approved IT Network / System connection is maintained until the appropriate UL certification has been obtained allowing it to be directly connected to our telephone system.
b.	The Facility Director after careful review of the attached MOU and consultation with the Facility’s CIO, (OEM) engineers, Biomedical and NFPA Engineers, ISO, HIPAA / Privacy Officer, Clinical Staff and JACHAO Officials has decided this risk-benefit analysis strongly favors purchasing replacement (OEM Mdl Nr) phones.

3.5 LAWN AREAS:
A.	General: Harrow and till to a depth of 100 mm (4 inches), new or existing lawn areas to remain, which are disturbed during construction. Establish existing or design grades by dragging or similar operations. Do not carry out lawn areas earthwork out when the soil is wet so that the tilth of the soil will be destroyed. Plant bed must be approved by Resident Engineer before seeding or sodding operation begins.

B.	Finished Grading: Begin finish grading after rough grading has had sufficient time for settlement. Scarify subgrade surface in lawn areas to a depth of 100 mm (4 inches). Apply topsoil so that after normal compaction, dragging and raking operations (to bring surface to indicated finish grades) there will be a minimum of 100 mm (4 inches) of topsoil over all lawn areas; make smooth, even surface and true grades, which will not allow water to stand at any point. Shape top and bottom of banks to form reverse curves in section; make junctions with undisturbed areas to conform to existing topography. Solid lines within grading limits indicate finished contours. Existing contours, indicated by broken lines are believed approximately correct but are not guaranteed.
C.	Fertilizing: Incorporate fertilizer into the soil to a depth of 100 mm (4 inches) at a rate of 12 kg/100 m2 (25 pounds per 1000 square feet).
D.	Seeding: Seed at a rate of 2 kg/100 m2 (4 pounds per 1000 square feet) and accomplished only during periods when uniform distribution may be assured. Lightly rake seed into bed immediately after seeding. Roll seeded area immediately with a roller not to exceed 225 kg/m (150 pounds per foot) of roller width.
E.	Sodding: Topsoil shall be firmed by rolling and during periods of high temperature the topsoil shall be watered lightly immediately prior to laying sod. Sod strips shall be tightly butted at the ends and staggered in a running bond fashion. Placement on slopes shall be from the bottom to top of slope with sod strips running across slope.

PART 3   EXECUTION 
3.1 SURFACE PREPARATION
A.	Allow new pavement surfaces to cure for a period of not less than 14 days before application of marking materials.
B.	Thoroughly clean all surfaces to be marked before application of paint. Remove dust, dirt, and other granular surface deposits by sweeping, blowing with compressed air, rinsing with water, or a combination of these methods. Completely remove rubber deposits, existing paint markings, and other coatings adhering to the pavement with scrapers, wire brushings, sandblasting, mechanical abrasion, or approved chemicals as directed by the Resident Engineer. The application of paint conforming to Fed. Spec. TT P 1952D is an option to removal of existing paint markings on asphalt pavement. Apply the black paint in as many coats as necessary to completely obliterate the existing markings. Where oil or grease are present on old pavements to be marked, scrub affected areas with several applications of trisodium phosphate solution or other approved detergent or degreaser, and rinse thoroughly after each application. After cleaning, seal oil soaked areas with cut shellac to prevent bleeding through the new paint. Pavement marking shall follow as closely as practicable after the surface has been cleaned and dried, but do not begin any marking until the Resident Engineer has inspected the surface and gives permission to proceed. The Contractor shall establish control points for marking and provide templates to control paint application by type and color at necessary intervals. The Contractor is responsible to preserve and apply marking in conformance with the established control points.
3.2 APPLICATION
	Apply uniformly painted  pavement marking of required color(s), length, and width with true, sharp edges and ends on properly cured, prepared, and dried surfaces in conformance with the details as shown and established control points. The length and width of lines shall conform within a tolerance of plus or minus 75 mm (3 inches) and plus or minus 3 mm (1/8 inch), respectively, in the case of skip markings. The length of intervals shall not exceed the line length tolerance. Temperature of the surface to be painted and the atmosphere shall be above 10?C (50?F) and less than 35?C (95?F). Apply the paint at a wet film thickness of 0.4 mm (0.015 inch). Apply paint in one coat. At the direction of the Resident Engineer, markings showing light spots may receive additional coats. The maximum drying time requirements of the paint specifications will be strictly enforced, to prevent undue softening of asphalt, and pick up, displacement, or discoloration by tires of traffic. If there is a deficiency in drying of the marking, discontinue paint operations until cause of the slow drying is determined and corrected. Remove and replace marking that is applied at less than minimum material rates; deviates from true alignment; exceeds stipulated length and width tolerances; or shows light spots, , smears, or other deficiencies or irregularities. Use carefully controlled sand blasting, approved grinding equipment, or other approved method to remove marking so that the surface to which the marking was applied will not be damaged.
3.3 PROTECTION
	Conduct operations in such a manner that necessary traffic can move without hindrance. Protect the newly painted markings so that, insofar as possible, the tires of passing vehicles will not pick up paint. Place warning signs at the beginning of the wet line, and at points well in advance of the marking equipment for alerting approaching traffic from both directions. Place small flags or other similarly effective small objects near freshly applied markings at frequent intervals to reduce crossing by traffic. Efface and replace damaged portions of markings at no additional cost to the Government.

3.4 DETAIL PAVEMENT MARKING
	Use Detail Pavement Markings, exclusive of actual traffic lane marking, at exit and entrance islands and turnouts, on curbs, at crosswalks, at parking bays, and at such other locations as shown. Place detail pavement markings of the color(s), width(s) and length(s), and design pattern at the locations shown.
