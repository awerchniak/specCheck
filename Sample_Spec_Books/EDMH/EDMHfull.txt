SECTION 00 05 01 

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR WORK WITHIN A VA HOSPITAL 

 

1.GENERAL: 

 

A. This section is to bring to the attention of the contractor, 
Special Requirements of our hospital. Our primary goal is to 
provide safe, accurate, comfortable treatment and diagnostic work. 
The construction project is secondary. The prints may show 
phasing but cannot convey every consideration that must be given 
to implement the plan. Close coordination and advance 
notifications must be provided. The VA cannot tolerate the method 
of construction as would be done in an empty building for example. 
Therefore, the contractor shall plan for cleanliness, dust 
proofing, quietness, etc., as needed. 

 

The following are considerations and requirements needed in order 
to work at the hospital. 

 

B. Requirements: 

INFECTION CONTROL PROCEDURES 

TO BE APPLIED TO ALL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS 

 

1. The overriding principal is to work within an area that is 
under negative pressure and contain all dust within the 
construction area. The contractor must organize whatever is 
necessary in order to achieve this. 


In order to accomplish the above, the CUBE method will be used. 
This method demands that a CUBE consisting of the floor, walls 
both above and below suspended ceilings and the deck above be 
established and maintained while construction is being 
performed. Walls may have to be built by the contractor if the 
existing walls cannot be utilized. The CUBE will be kept under 
negative pressure. In addition to containing dust within the 
work area, dust must be kept from exiting the work area via 
footsteps and cart wheels. 

The project will have an ICRA (Infection Control Risk 
Assessment) completed prior to any construction or phase of 


construction. This document will be posted and maintained at 
the construction site and serve as reminder of the precautions 
to be followed. The ICRA will address the following: 

 

ICRA 

. To be posted before any work is done and reviewed at each 
phase for any adjustment needed. 
. To be initiated by IC (Infection Control department) or 
Engineering and signed off by both parties. 
. ICRA forms will be kept by Safety and IC. 


Infection Control briefing 

. An overview of infection control will be given at the 
preconstruction conference. 
. Superintendant will be required to attend the preconstruction 
conference. 


Barrier plan 

. Contractor will sketch out the placements of his barrier(s) 
and get approval by IC via the COTR. 
. Barrier will be inspected by IC before each phase is started. 
. Hard wall (drywall and metal studs) barriers will be used for 
work lasting longer than 24 hours. Tape and floating will 
not be needed. Joints will be covered with blue painters 
tape including attachment at walls, floors and ceilings. 
. Plastic (fire-resistive ) can be used for work lasting 24 
hours or less on barriers below ceilings. Plastic may be 
used for periods exceeding 24 hours above ceilings. 
. The contractor may use the VA’s Curtain-Wall system utilizing 
his own plastic. 
. Barrier must also serve as physical barrier for when the area 
is not occupied by contactors. Entry will be via an actual 
door and frame and will be locked when not occupied. 


Negative Air 

. Existing ceilings may be used as part of the CUBE barrier. 
. Minus .03 inches of water pressure must be maintained. The 
contractor is responsible for providing negative air unit(s) 



as needed to maintain .03 inches of pressure. Contractor 
must install a manometer with a scale of 0-1/2 inch water for 
each pressure area. 
. Discharge into a corridor via a grill. The VA must prove 
that air discharged is clean (HEPA) via a particle meter 
before the unit is turned on and any work started. 


Mats 

. Carpet shall not be used. Contractor must clean his wheels 
and feet in the anteroom so that no dust is tracked down the 
hall. 
. Sticky mats will be used in class 3 and 4 construction and 
will be changed every 4 hours. 


Anteroom 

. Serves as an air lock and a place to remove dust from people, 
carts, feet, etc. 
. Can be built inside the construction area or if built in the 
corridor, 5 feet clearance must be maintained. 
. Must be hard walls. 
. Air flow will be from the outside common space into the 
anteroom and then into the construction area. 


Gross demolition 

. Tyvek coveralls and disposable shoe covers must be worn 
during gross demolition phase which is defined as wall, 
ceiling and flooring removal. 
. Use covered carts or containers when transporting waste down 
approved routes. 
. Disposable items are to be used one time. 
. Must be removed in the ante room before leaving the work 
area. 


Existing HVAC Grills 

. Must seal all grills – supply, return, and exhaust. 
. Seal by substantial method to prevent barrier from coming 
loose. Use blue painter tape only and do not use duct tape 
anywhere. 


Above Ceiling Inspections – as part of work planning 


. Allowed to remove one tile per 50 square feet for inspection 
with no IC control. 
. No work will be allowed without IC control with the exception 
of allowing cable pulling which may be done with the CUBE 
method. 


Fire or Smoke barriers 

. Temporary barriers must be built to give the same rating 
through an alternate path when existing barriers must be 
compromised. 
. Permanent new rated walls and ceilings (as needed) will be 
built before existing rated barriers are compromised. 


 

General 

. Clean the work area daily to control the amount of 
accumulated dust from collecting within the work area. 
. Ceiling T-grids must be vacuumed before tile is placed. 
. Utility runs that don’t necessarily have work contained to a 
room will still have to confirm to the CUBE method. A 
plastic barrier will have to be placed over the location of a 
utility run and secured to the remaining ceiling in 
conjunction with existing walls and / or barrier walls. 


2. Telephone and Computer Wiring: 

 

All telephone and computer jacks shall be removed by the VA as 
needed. At the pre-construction walkthrough, the contractor 
shall discuss timeframes for removal with the COTR (Contracting 
Officer’s Technical Representative) who will contact the VA’s 
telecommunications group for actual removal. THE CONTRACTOR 
SHALL NOT ATTEMPT ANY REMOVAL INCLUDING THE UNPLUGGING OF 
PHONES AND COMPUTERS. 

 

3. The Fire Alarm devices – smoke detectors, heat detectors and 
pull stations, are all addressed devices. Do not remove any of 
these devices. If they must be removed, please contact the 
COTR. 

 


4. Penetrations through floors and rated walls must be firestopped 
with materials made from the specific application at 
hand. Sealing must be done at the time the penetration is made 
and not done at the end of the job.

1. The contractor will turn over no less than 3 % of each product 
used for station stock. 

 

2. Materials to be turned over is limited to flooring (roll carpet 
is not needed) and specialty ceiling tile. Turn over material 
in original containers. 

 

D. Electric outlets and Data jacks : 

 

1. Every job results in the need for additional electric and data 
jacks needed. The contractor will include in his price, work 
to install electric outlets and data jacks as directed. 

 

2. The outlets and jacks will be required at the very end of the 
project. The VA will survey the new space with the users and 
will give a list of where any are needed. 

 

3. The Contractor shall provide one duplex outlet (either normal or 
emergency power) and one triplex data jack per 1000 gross 
square feet (rounded) of new or renovated built.

installed. Conversely, the VA will pay for any additional 
needed. 

 

E. Other Areas of Concern: 

 


1. When construction is near sensitive areas such as surgery, 
noisy operations shall be discontinued until a more appropriate 
time, which may be after normal working hours or on weekends. 
If this has been determined, it shall be accomplished at no 
additional cost to the VA. 

 

2. The contractor shall notify the COTR in advance of operations 
that would cause disruption to the operation of the medical 
center. Examples of these disruptions are: utility shutdown, 
noise, vibration, etc. The contractor shall adjust his

in the aggregate. 

5. Certify, in duplicate, ingredients and proportions and amounts of 
ingredients in concrete conform to approved trial mixes. When 
concrete is batched or mixed off immediate building site, certify (by 
signing, initialing or stamping thereon) on delivery slips 
(duplicate) that ingredients in truck-load mixes conform to 
proportions of aggregate weight, cement factor, and water-cement 
ratio of approved trial mixes. 

B. Field Inspection and Materials Testing: 

1. Provide a technician at site of placement at all times to perform 
concrete sampling and testing. 

2. Review the delivery tickets of the ready-mix concrete trucks arriving 
on-site. Notify the Contractor if the concrete cannot be placed 
within the specified time limits or if the type of concrete delivered 
is incorrect. Reject any loads that do not comply with the 
Specification requirements. Rejected loads are to be removed from the 
site at the Contractor’s expense. Any rejected concrete that is 
placed will be subject to removal. 

3. Take concrete samples at point of placement in accordance with ASTM 
C172. Mold and cure compression test cylinders in accordance with 
ASTM C31. Make at least three cylinders for each 40 m3 (50 cubic 
yards) or less of each concrete type, and at least three cylinders 
for any one day's pour for each concrete type. Label each cylinder 
with an identification number. Resident Engineer may require 
additional cylinders to be molded and cured under job conditions. 

4. Perform slump tests in accordance with ASTM C143. Test the first 
truck each day, and every time test cylinders are made. Test pumped 
concrete at the hopper and at the discharge end of the hose at the 
beginning of each day’s pumping operations to determine change in 
slump. 


5. Determine the air content of concrete per ASTM C173. For concrete 
required to be air-entrained, test the first truck and every 20 m3 
(25 cubic yards) thereafter each day. For concrete not required to be 
air-entrained, test every 80 m3 (100 cubic yards) at random. For 
pumped concrete, initially test concrete at both the hopper and the 
discharge end of the hose to determine change in air content. 

6. If slump or air content fall outside specified limits, make another 
test immediately from another portion of same batch. 

7. Perform unit weight tests in compliance with ASTM C138 for normal 
weight concrete and ASTM C567 for lightweight concrete. Test the 
first truck and each time cylinders are made. 

8. Notify laboratory technician at batch plant of mix irregularities and 
request materials and proportioning check. 

9. Verify that specified mixing has been accomplished. 

10. Environmental Conditions: Determine the temperature per ASTM C1064 
for each truckload of concrete during hot weather and cold weather 
concreting operations:

SECTION 01 91 00 

GENERAL COMMISSIONING REQUIREMENTS 

PART 1 - GENERAL 

1.1 COMMISSIONING DESCRIPTION 

A. This Section 01 91 00 GENERAL COMMISSIONING REQUIREMENTS shall form the 
basis of the construction phase commissioning process and procedures. 
The Commissioning Agent shall add, modify, and refine the commissioning 
procedures, as approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to 
suit field conditions and actual manufacturer's equipment, incorporate 
test data and procedure results, and provide detailed scheduling for 
all commissioning tasks. 

B. Various sections of the project specifications require equipment 
startup, testing, and adjusting services. Requirements for startup, 
testing, and adjusting services specified in Division 21, Division 22, 
Division 23, Division 26, Division 27, and Division 28 series sections 
of these specifications are intended to be provided in coordination 
with the commissioning services and are not intended to duplicate 
services. The Contractor shall coordinate the work required by 
individual specification sections with the commissioning services 
requirements specified herein. 

C. Where individual testing, adjusting, or related services are required 
in the project specifications and not specifically required by this 
commissioning requirements specification, the specified services shall 
be provided and copies of documentation, as required by those 
specifications shall be submitted to the VA and the Commissioning Agent 
to be indexed for future reference. 

D. Where training or educational services for VA are required and 
specified in other sections of the specifications, including but not 
limited to Division 21, Division 22, Division 23, Division 26, Division 
27, and Division 28 series sections of the specification, these 
services are intended to be provided in addition to the training and 
educational services specified herein. 

E. Commissioning is a systematic process of verifying that the building 
systems perform interactively according to the construction documents 
and the VA’s operational needs. The commissioning process shall 
encompass and coordinate the system documentation, equipment startup, 
control system calibration, testing and balancing, performance testing 


and training. Commissioning during the construction and post-occupancy 
phases is intended to achieve the following specific objectives 
according to the contract documents: 

1. Verify that the applicable equipment and systems are installed in 
accordance with the contact documents and according to the 
manufacturer's recommendations. 

2. Verify and document proper integrated performance of equipment and 
systems. 

3. Verify that Operations & Maintenance documentation is complete. 

4. Verify that all components requiring servicing can be accessed, 
serviced and removed without disturbing nearby components including 
ducts, piping, cabling or wiring. 

5. Verify that the VA’s operating personnel are adequately trained to 
enable them to operate, monitor, adjust, maintain, and repair 
building systems in an effective and energy-efficient manner. 

6. Document the successful achievement of the commissioning objectives 
listed above. 

F. The commissioning process does not take away from or reduce the 
responsibility of the Contractor to provide a finished and fully 
functioning product. 

1.2 CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS 

A. For this construction project, the Department of Veterans Affairs 
contracts with a Contractor to provide construction services. The 
contracts are administered by the VA Contracting Officer and the COR as 
the designated representative of the Contracting Officer. On this 
project, the authority to modify the contract in any way is strictly 
limited to the authority of the Contracting Officer. 

B. In this project, only two contract parties are recognized and 
communications on contractual issues are strictly limited to VA COR and 
the Contractor. It is the practice of the VA to require that 
communications between other parties to the contracts (Subcontractors 
and Vendors) be conducted through the COR and Contractor. It is also 
the practice of the VA that communications between other parties of the 
project (Commissioning Agent and Architect/Engineer) be conducted 
through the COR. 

C. Whole Building Commissioning is a process that relies upon frequent and 
direct communications, as well as collaboration between all parties to 
the construction process. By its nature, a high level of communication 


and cooperation between the Commissioning Agent and all other parties 
(Architects, Engineers, Subcontractors, Vendors, third party testing 
agencies, etc.) is essential to the success of the Commissioning 
effort. 

D. With these fundamental practices in mind, the commissioning process 
described herein has been developed to recognize that, in the execution 
of the Commissioning Process, the Commissioning Agent must develop 
effective methods to communicate with every member of the construction 
team involved in delivering commissioned systems while simultaneously 
respecting the exclusive contract authority of the Contracting Officer 
and COR. Thus, the procedures outlined in this specification must be 
executed within the following limitations: 

1. No communications (verbal or written) from the Commissioning Agent 
shall be deemed to constitute direction that modifies the terms of 
any contract between the Department of Veterans Affairs and the 
Contractor. 

2. Commissioning Issues identified by the Commissioning Agent will be 
delivered to the COR and copied to the designated Commissioning 
Representatives for the Contractor and subcontractors on the 
Commissioning Team for information only in order to expedite the 
communication process. These issues must be understood as the 
professional opinion of the Commissioning Agent and as suggestions 
for resolution. 

3. In the event that any Commissioning Issues and suggested resolutions 
are deemed by the COR to require either an official interpretation 
of the construction documents or require a modification of the 
contract documents, the Contracting Officer or COR will issue an 
official directive to this effect. 

4. All parties to the Commissioning Process shall be individually 
responsible for alerting the COR of any issues that they deem to 
constitute a potential contract change prior to acting on these 
issues. 

5. Authority for resolution or modification of design and construction 
issues rests solely with the Contracting Officer or COR, with 
appropriate technical guidance from the Architect/Engineer and/or 
Commissioning Agent.

3.2 STARTUP, INITIAL CHECKOUT, AND PRE-FUNCTIONAL CHECKLISTS 

A. The following procedures shall apply to all equipment and systems to be 
commissioned, according to Part 1, Systems to Be Commissioned. 

1. Pre-Functional Checklists are important to ensure that the equipment 
and systems are hooked up and operational. These ensure that Systems 
Functional Performance Testing may proceed without unnecessary 
delays. Each system to be commissioned shall have a full Pre- 
Functional Checklist completed by the Contractor prior to Systems 
Functional Performance Testing. No sampling strategies are used. 

a. The Pre-Functional Checklist will identify the trades responsible 
for completing the checklist. The Contractor shall ensure the 
appropriate trades complete the checklists. 

b. The Commissioning Agent will review completed Pre-Functional 
Checklists and field-verify the accuracy of the completed 
checklist using sampling techniques. 

2. Startup and Initial Checkout Plan: The Contractor shall develop 
detailed startup plans for all equipment. The primary role of the 
Contractor in this process is to ensure that there is written 
documentation that each of the manufacturer recommended procedures 
have been completed. Parties responsible for startup shall be 
identified in the Startup Plan and in the checklist forms. 

a. The Contractor shall develop the full startup plan by combining 
(or adding to) the checklists with the manufacturer's detailed 
startup and checkout procedures from the O&M manual data and the 
field checkout sheets normally used by the Contractor. The plan 
shall include checklists and procedures with specific boxes or 
lines for recording and documenting the checking and inspections 
of each procedure and a summary statement with a signature block 
at the end of the plan. 

b. The full startup plan shall at a minimum consist of the following 
items: 

1) The Pre-Functional Checklists. 

2) The manufacturer's standard written startup procedures copied 
from the installation manuals with check boxes by each 
procedure and a signature block added by hand at the end. 

3) The manufacturer's normally used field checkout sheets. 

c. The Commissioning Agent will submit the full startup plan to the 
VA and Contractor for review. Final approval will be by the VA. 


d. The Contractor shall review and evaluate the procedures and the 
format for documenting them, noting any procedures that need to 
be revised or added. 

3. Sensor and Actuator Calibration 

a. All field installed temperature, relative humidity, CO2 and 
pressure sensors and gages, and all actuators (dampers and 
valves) on all equipment shall be calibrated using the methods 
described in Division 21, Division 22, Division 23, Division 26, 
Division 27, and Division 28 specifications. 

b. All procedures used shall be fully documented on the Pre- 
Functional Checklists or other suitable forms, clearly 
referencing the procedures followed and written documentation of 
initial, intermediate and final results. 

4. Execution of Equipment Startup 

a. Four weeks prior to equipment startup, the Contractor shall 
schedule startup and checkout with the VA and Commissioning 
Agent. The performance of the startup and checkout shall be 
directed and executed by the Contractor. 

b. The Commissioning Agent will observe the startup procedures for 
selected pieces of primary equipment. 

c. The Contractor shall execute startup and provide the VA and 
Commissioning Agent with a signed and dated copy of the completed 
startup checklists, and contractor tests. 

d. Only individuals that have direct knowledge and witnessed that a 
line item task on the Startup Checklist was actually performed 
shall initial or check that item off. It is not acceptable for 
witnessing supervisors to fill out these forms. 

3.3 DEFICIENCIES, NONCONFORMANCE, AND APPROVAL IN CHECKLISTS AND STARTUP 

A. The Contractor shall clearly list any outstanding items of the initial 
startup and Pre-Functional Checklist procedures that were not completed 
successfully, at the bottom of the procedures form or on an attached 
sheet. The procedures form and any outstanding deficiencies shall be 
provided to the VA and the Commissioning Agent within two days of 
completion. 

B. The Commissioning Agent will review the report and submit comments to 
the VA. The Commissioning Agent will work with the Contractor to 
correct and verify deficiencies or uncompleted items. The Commissioning 
Agent will involve the VA and others as necessary. The Contractor shall 


correct all areas that are noncompliant or incomplete in the checklists 
in a timely manner, and shall notify the VA and Commissioning Agent as 
soon as outstanding items have been corrected. The Contractor shall 
submit an updated startup report and a Statement of Correction on the 
original noncompliance report. When satisfactorily completed, the 
Commissioning Agent will recommend approval of the checklists and 
startup of each system to the VA. 

C. The Contractor shall be responsible for resolution of deficiencies as 
directed the VA. 

3.4 PHASED COMMISSIONING 

A. The project may require startup and initial checkout to be executed in 
phases. This phasing shall be planned and scheduled in a coordination 
meeting of the VA, Commissioning Agent, and the Contractor. Results 
will be added to the master construction schedule and the commissioning 
schedule. 

3.5 DDC SYSTEM TRENDING FOR COMMISSIONING 

A. Trending is a method of testing as a standalone method or to augment 
manual testing. The Contractor shall trend any and all points of the 
system or systems at intervals specified below. 

B. Alarms are a means to notify the system operator that abnormal 
conditions are present in the system. Alarms shall be structured into 
three tiers – Critical, Priority, and Maintenance. 

1. Critical alarms are intended to be alarms that require the immediate 
attention of and action by the Operator. These alarms shall be 
displayed on the Operator Workstation in a popup style window that 
is graphically linked to the associated unit's graphical display. 
The popup style window shall be displayed on top of any active 
window within the screen, including non DDC system software. 

2. Priority level alarms are to be printed to a printer which is 
connected to the Operator’s Work Station located within the 
engineer’s office. Additionally Priority level alarms shall be able 
to be monitored and viewed through an active alarm application. 
Priority level alarms are alarms which shall require reaction from 
the operator or maintenance personnel within a normal work shift, 
and not immediate action. 

3. Maintenance alarms are intended to be minor issues which would 
require examination by maintenance personnel within the following 
shift. These alarms shall be generated in a scheduled report 


automatically by the DDC system at the start of each shift. The 
generated maintenance report will be printed to a printer located 
within the engineer’s office. 

C. The Contractor shall provide a wireless internet network in the 
building for use during controls programming, checkout, and 
commissioning. This network will allow project team members to more 
effectively program, view, manipulate and test control devices while 
being in the same room as the controlled device. 

D. The Contractor shall provide graphical trending through the DDC control 
system of systems being commissioned. Trending requirements are 
indicated below and included with the Systems Functional Performance 
Test Procedures. Trending shall occur before, during and after Systems 
Functional Performance Testing. The Contractor shall be responsible for 
producing graphical representations of the trended DDC points that show 
each system operating properly during steady state conditions as well 
as during the System Functional Testing. These graphical reports shall 
be submitted to the COR and Commissioning Agent for review and analysis 
before, during dynamic operation, and after Systems Functional 
Performance Testing. The Contractor shall provide, but not limited to, 
the following trend requirements and trend submissions: 

1. Pre-testing, Testing, and Post-testing – Trend reports of trend logs 
and graphical trend plots are required as defined by the 
Commissioning Agent. The trend log points, sampling rate, graphical 
plot configuration, and duration will be dictated by the 
Commissioning Agent. At any time during the Commissioning Process 
the Commissioning Agent may recommend changes to aspects of trending 
as deemed necessary for proper system analysis. The Contractor shall 
implement any changes as directed by the COR. Any pre-test trend 
analysis comments generated by the Commissioning Team should be 
addressed and resolved by the Contractor, as directed by the COR, 
prior to the execution of Systems Functional Performance Testing. 

2. Dynamic plotting – The Contractor shall also provide dynamic 
plotting during Systems Functional Performance testing at frequent 
intervals for points determined by the Systems Functional 
Performance Test Procedure. The graphical plots will be formatted 
and plotted at durations listed in the Systems Functional 
Performance Test Procedure. 


3. Graphical plotting - The graphical plots shall be provided with a 
dual y-axis allowing 15 or more trend points (series) plotted 
simultaneously on the graph with each series in distinct color. The 
plots will further require title, axis naming, legend etc. all 
described by the Systems Functional Performance Test Procedure. If 
this cannot be sufficiently accomplished directly in the Direct 
Digital Control System then it is the responsibility of the 
Contractor to plot these trend logs in Microsoft Excel. 

4. The following tables indicate the points to be trended and alarmed 
by system. The Operational Trend Duration column indicates the 
trend duration for normal operations. The Testing Trend Duration 
column indicates the trend duration prior to Systems Functional 
Performance Testing and again after Systems Functional Performance 
Testing. The Type column indicates point type: AI = Analog Input, 
AO = Analog Output, DI = Digital Input, DO = Digital Output, Calc = 
Calculated Point. In the Trend Interval Column, COV = Change of 
Value. The Alarm Type indicates the alarm priority; C = Critical, P 
= Priority, and M = Maintenance. The Alarm Range column indicates 
when the point is considered in the alarm state. The Alarm Delay 
column indicates the length of time the point must remain in an 
alarm state before the alarm is recorded in the DDC. The intent is 
to allow minor, short-duration events to be corrected by the DDC 
system prior to recording an alarm.

3.6 SYSTEMS FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE TESTING 

A. This paragraph applies to Systems Functional Performance Testing of 
systems for all referenced specification Divisions. 

B. Objectives and Scope: The objective of Systems Functional Performance 
Testing is to demonstrate that each system is operating according to 
the Contract Documents. Systems Functional Performance Testing 
facilitates bringing the systems from a state of substantial completion 
to full dynamic operation. Additionally, during the testing process, 
areas of noncompliant performance are identified and corrected, thereby 
improving the operation and functioning of the systems. In general, 
each system shall be operated through all modes of operation (seasonal, 
occupied, unoccupied, warm-up, cool-down, part- and full-load, fire 
alarm and emergency power) where there is a specified system response. 
The Contractor shall verify each sequence in the sequences of 
operation. Proper responses to such modes and conditions as power 
failure, freeze condition, low oil pressure, no flow, equipment 
failure, etc. shall also be tested. 

C. Development of Systems Functional Performance Test Procedures: Before 
Systems Functional Performance Test procedures are written, the 
Contractor shall submit all requested documentation and a current list 


of change orders affecting equipment or systems, including an updated 
points list, program code, control sequences and parameters. Using the 
testing parameters and requirements found in the Contract Documents and 
approved submittals and shop drawings, the Commissioning Agent will 
develop specific Systems Functional Test Procedures to verify and 
document proper operation of each piece of equipment and system to be 
commissioned. The Contractor shall assist the Commissioning Agent in 
developing the Systems Functional Performance Test procedures as 
requested by the Commissioning Agent i.e. by answering questions about 
equipment, operation, sequences, etc. Prior to execution, the 
Commissioning Agent will provide a copy of the Systems Functional 
Performance Test procedures to the VA, the Architect/Engineer, and the 
Contractor, who shall review the tests for feasibility, safety, 
equipment and warranty protection. 

D. Purpose of Test Procedures: The purpose of each specific Systems 
Functional Performance Test is to verify and document compliance with 
the stated criteria of acceptance given on the test form. 
Representative test formats and examples are found in the Commissioning 
Plan for this project. (The Commissioning Plan is issued as a separate 
document and is available for review.) The test procedure forms 
developed by the Commissioning Agent will include, but not be limited 
to, the following information: 

1. System and equipment or component name(s) 

2. Equipment location and ID number 

3. Unique test ID number, and reference to unique Pre-Functional 
Checklists and startup documentation, and ID numbers for the piece 
of equipment 

4. Date 

5. Project name 

6. Participating parties

8. A copy of the specific sequence of operations or other specified 
parameters being verified 

9. Formulas used in any calculations 

10. Required pretest field measurements 

11. Instructions for setting up the test. 

12. Special cautions, alarm limits, etc. 


13. Specific step-by-step procedures to execute the test, in a clear, 
sequential and repeatable format 

14. Acceptance criteria of proper performance with a Yes / No check box 
to allow for clearly marking whether or not proper performance of 
each part of the test was achieved. 

15. A section for comments. 

16. Signatures and date block for the Commissioning Agent. A place for 
the Contractor to initial to signify attendance at the test. 

E. Test Methods: Systems Functional Performance Testing shall be achieved 
by manual testing (i.e. persons manipulate the equipment and observe 
performance) and/or by monitoring the performance and analyzing the 
results using the control system's trend log capabilities or by 
standalone data loggers. The Contractor and Commissioning Agent shall 
determine which method is most appropriate for tests that do not have a 
method specified. 

1. Simulated Conditions: Simulating conditions (not by an overwritten 
value) shall be allowed, although timing the testing to experience 
actual conditions is encouraged wherever practical. 

2. Overwritten Values: Overwriting sensor values to simulate a 
condition, such as overwriting the outside air temperature reading 
in a control system to be something other than it really is, shall 
be allowed, but shall be used with caution and avoided when 
possible. Such testing methods often can only test a part of a 
system, as the interactions and responses of other systems will be 
erroneous or not applicable. Simulating a condition is preferable. 
e.g., for the above case, by heating the outside air sensor with a 
hair blower rather than overwriting the value or by altering the 
appropriate setpoint to see the desired response. Before simulating 
conditions or overwriting values, sensors, transducers and devices 
shall have been calibrated. 

3. Simulated Signals: Using a signal generator which creates a 
simulated signal to test and calibrate transducers and DDC constants 
is generally recommended over using the sensor to act as the signal 
generator via simulated conditions or overwritten values. 

4. Altering Setpoints: Rather than overwriting sensor values, and when 
simulating conditions is difficult, altering setpoints to test a 
sequence is acceptable. For example, to see the Air Conditioning 
compressor lockout initiate at an outside air temperature below 12 C 


(54 F), when the outside air temperature is above 12 C (54 F), 
temporarily change the lockout setpoint to be 2 C (4 F) above the 
current outside air temperature. 

5. Indirect Indicators: Relying on indirect indicators for responses 
or performance shall be allowed only after visually and directly 
verifying and documenting, over the range of the tested parameters, 
that the indirect readings through the control system represent 
actual conditions and responses. Much of this verification shall be 
completed during systems startup and initial checkout. 

F. Setup: Each function and test shall be performed under conditions that 
simulate actual conditions as closely as is practically possible. The 
Contractor shall provide all necessary materials, system modifications, 
etc. to produce the necessary flows, pressures, temperatures, etc. 
necessary to execute the test according to the specified conditions. At 
completion of the test, the Contractor shall return all affected 
building equipment and systems, due to these temporary modifications, 
to their pretest condition. 

G. Sampling: No sampling is allowed in completing Pre-Functional 
Checklists. Sampling is allowed for Systems Functional Performance 
Test Procedures execution. The Commissioning Agent will determine the 
sampling rate. If at any point, frequent failures are occurring and 
testing is becoming more troubleshooting than verification, the 
Commissioning Agent may stop the testing and require the Contractor to 
perform and document a checkout of the remaining units, prior to 
continuing with Systems Functional Performance Testing of the remaining 
units. 

H. Cost of Retesting: The cost associated with expanded sample System 
Functional Performance Tests shall be solely the responsibility of the 
Contractor. Any required retesting by the Contractor shall not be 
considered a justified reason for a claim of delay or for a time 
extension by the Contractor. 

I. Coordination and Scheduling: The Contractor shall provide a minimum of 
7 days’ notice to the Commissioning Agent and the VA regarding the 
completion schedule for the Pre-Functional Checklists and startup of 
all equipment and systems. The Commissioning Agent will schedule 
Systems Functional Performance Tests with the Contractor and VA. The 
Commissioning Agent will witness and document the Systems Functional 


Performance Testing of systems. The Contractor shall execute the tests 
in accordance with the Systems Functional Performance Test Procedure. 

J. Testing Prerequisites: In general, Systems Functional Performance 
Testing will be conducted only after Pre-Functional Checklists have 
been satisfactorily completed. The control system shall be sufficiently 
tested and approved by the Commissioning Agent and the VA before it is 
used to verify performance of other components or systems. The air 
balancing and water balancing shall be completed before Systems 
Functional Performance Testing of air-related or water-related 
equipment or systems are scheduled. Systems Functional Performance 
Testing will proceed from components to subsystems to systems. When the 
proper performance of all interacting individual systems has been 
achieved, the interface or coordinated responses between systems will 
be checked. 

K. Problem Solving: The Commissioning Agent will recommend solutions to 
problems found, however the burden of responsibility to solve, correct 
and retest problems is with the Contractor. 

3.7 DOCUMENTATION, NONCONFORMANCE AND APPROVAL OF TESTS 

A. Documentation: The Commissioning Agent will witness, and document the 
results of all Systems Functional Performance Tests using the specific 
procedural forms developed by the Commissioning Agent for that purpose. 
Prior to testing, the Commissioning Agent will provide these forms to 
the VA and the Contractor for review and approval. The Contractor shall 
include the filled out forms with the O&M manual data. 

B. Nonconformance: The Commissioning Agent will record the results of the 
Systems Functional Performance Tests on the procedure or test form. All 
items of nonconformance issues will be noted and reported to the VA on 
Commissioning Field Reports and/or the Commissioning Master Issues Log. 

1. Corrections of minor items of noncompliance identified may be made 
during the tests. In such cases, the item of noncompliance and 
resolution shall be documented on the Systems Functional Test 
Procedure. 

2. Every effort shall be made to expedite the systems functional 
Performance Testing process and minimize unnecessary delays, while 
not compromising the integrity of the procedures. However, the 
Commissioning Agent shall not be pressured into overlooking 
noncompliant work or loosening acceptance criteria to satisfy 


scheduling or cost issues, unless there is an overriding reason to 
do so by direction from the VA. 

3. As the Systems Functional Performance Tests progresses and an item 
of noncompliance is identified, the Commissioning Agent shall 
discuss the issue with the Contractor and the VA. 

4. When there is no dispute on an item of noncompliance, and the 
Contractor accepts responsibility to correct it: 

a. The Commissioning Agent will document the item of noncompliance 
and the Contractor's response and/or intentions. The Systems 
Functional Performance Test then continues or proceeds to another 
test or sequence. After the day's work is complete, the 
Commissioning Agent will submit a Commissioning Field Report to 
the VA. The Commissioning Agent will also note items of 
noncompliance and the Contractor’s response in the Master 
Commissioning Issues Log. The Contractor shall correct the item 
of noncompliance and report completion to the VA and the 
Commissioning Agent. 

b. The need for retesting will be determined by the Commissioning 
Agent. If retesting is required, the Commissioning Agent and the 
Contractor shall reschedule the test and the test shall be 
repeated. 

5. If there is a dispute about item of noncompliance, regarding whether 
it is an item of noncompliance, or who is responsible: 

a. The item of noncompliance shall be documented on the test form 
with the Contractor's response. The item of noncompliance with 
the Contractor’s response shall also be reported on a 
Commissioning Field Report and on the Master Commissioning Issues 
Log. 

b. Resolutions shall be made at the lowest management level 
possible. Other parties are brought into the discussions as 
needed. Final interpretive and acceptance authority is with the 
Department of Veterans Affairs. 

c. The Commissioning Agent will document the resolution process. 

d. Once the interpretation and resolution have been decided, the 
Contractor shall correct the item of noncompliance, report it to 
the Commissioning Agent. The requirement for retesting will be 
determined by the Commissioning Agent. If retesting is required, 
the Commissioning Agent and the Contractor shall reschedule the 


test. Retesting shall be repeated until satisfactory performance 
is achieved. 

C. Cost of Retesting: The cost to retest a System Functional Performance 
Test shall be solely the responsibility of the Contractor. Any 
required retesting by the Contractor shall not be considered a 
justified reason for a claim of delay or for a time extension by the 
Contractor. 

D. Failure Due to Manufacturer Defect: If 10%, or three, whichever is 
greater, of identical pieces (size alone does not constitute a 
difference) of equipment fail to perform in compliance with the 
Contract Documents (mechanically or substantively) due to manufacturing 
defect, not allowing it to meet its submitted performance 
specifications, all identical units may be considered unacceptable by 
the VA. In such case, the Contractor shall provide the VA with the 
following: 

1. Within one week of notification from the VA, the Contractor shall 
examine all other identical units making a record of the findings. 
The findings shall be provided to the VA within two weeks of the 
original notice. 

2. Within two weeks of the original notification, the Contractor shall 
provide a signed and dated, written explanation of the problem, 
cause of failures, etc. and all proposed solutions which shall 
include full equipment submittals. The proposed solutions shall not 
significantly exceed the specification requirements of the original 
installation. 

3. The VA shall determine whether a replacement of all identical units 
or a repair is acceptable. 

4. Two examples of the proposed solution shall be installed by the 
Contractor and the VA shall be allowed to test the installations for 
up to one week, upon which the VA will decide whether to accept the 
solution. 

5. Upon acceptance, the Contractor shall replace or repair all 
identical items, at their expense and extend the warranty 
accordingly, if the original equipment warranty had begun. The 
replacement/repair work shall proceed with reasonable speed 
beginning within one week from when parts can be obtained. 

E. Approval: The Commissioning Agent will note each satisfactorily 
demonstrated function on the test form. Formal approval of the Systems 


Functional Performance Test shall be made later after review by the 
Commissioning Agent and by the VA. The Commissioning Agent will 
evaluate each test and report to the VA using a standard form. The VA 
will give final approval on each test using the same form, and provide 
signed copies to the Commissioning Agent and the Contractor. 

3.8 DEFERRED TESTING 

A. Unforeseen Deferred Systems Functional Performance Tests: If any 
Systems Functional Performance Test cannot be completed due to the 
building structure, required occupancy condition or other conditions, 
execution of the Systems Functional Performance Testing may be delayed 
upon approval of the VA. These Systems Functional Performance Tests 
shall be conducted in the same manner as the seasonal tests as soon as 
possible. Services of the Contractor to conduct these unforeseen 
Deferred Systems Functional Performance Tests shall be negotiated 
between the VA and the Contractor. 

B. Deferred Seasonal Testing: Deferred Seasonal Systems Functional 
Performance Tests are those that must be deferred until weather 
conditions are closer to the systems design parameters. The 
Commissioning Agent will review systems parameters and recommend which 
Systems Functional Performance Tests should be deferred until weather 
conditions more closely match systems parameters. The Contractor shall 
review and comment on the proposed schedule for Deferred Seasonal 
Testing. The VA will review and approve the schedule for Deferred 
Seasonal Testing. Deferred Seasonal Systems Functional Performances 
Tests shall be witnessed and documented by the Commissioning Agent. 
Deferred Seasonal Systems Functional Performance Tests shall be 
executed by the Contractor in accordance with these specifications.

the dates of all revisions. 

2. The survey drawing(s) submitted shall bear the following 
certification adjacent to the Engineer's official seal: 

 "I hereby certify that all information indicated on this drawing was 
obtained or verified by actual measurements in the field and that 
every effort has been made to furnish complete and accurate 
information." 

3. Vicinity map showing the property surveyed in reference to nearby 
highways or major street intersections. 

4. Flood zone designation (with proper annotation based on Federal 
Flood Insurance Rate Maps or the state or local equivalent, by 
scaled map location and graphic plotting only). 

5. Land area as defined by the boundaries of the legal description of 
the surveyed premises, including legal description of the land. 

6. All data necessary to indicate the mathematical dimensions and 
relationships of the boundary represented by bearings and distances, 
and the length and radius of each curve, together with elements 
necessary to mathematically define each curve. The point of 
beginning of the surveyor's description and the basis of bearings 
shall also be shown. 

7. When record bearings or angles or distances differ from measured 
bearings, angles or distances, both record and measured bearings, 
angles, and distances shall be clearly indicated. If the record 
description fails to form a mathematically closed figure, the 
surveyor shall so indicate. 

8. Measured and record distances from corners of parcels surveyed to 
the nearest right-of-way lines of streets in urban or suburban 
areas, together with recovered lot corners and evidence of lot 
corners, shall be noted. The distances to the nearest intersecting 
street shall be indicated and verified. Names and widths of streets 


and highways abutting the property surveyed and widths of rights of 
way shall be given. Observable evidence of access (or lack thereof) 
to such abutting streets or highways shall be indicated. Observable 
evidence of private roads shall be so indicated. Streets abutting

way maps, or similar documents which the survey represents, wholly 
or in part, with their appropriate recording data. The survey shall 
indicate platted setback or building restriction lines which have 
been recorded in subdivision plats or which appear in a Record 
Document which has been delivered to the surveyor. Contiguity, 
gores, and overlaps along the exterior boundaries of the survey 
premises, where ascertainable from field evidence or Record 
Documents, or interior to those exterior boundaries, shall be 
clearly indicated or noted. Where only a part of a recorded lot or 
parcel is included in the survey, the balance of the lot or parcel 
shall be indicated. 

10. All evidence of found monuments shall be shown and noted. All 
evidence of monuments found beyond the surveyed premises on which 
establishment of the corners of the survey premises are dependent, 
and their application related to the survey shall be indicated. 

11. The character of any and all evidence of possession shall be 
stated and the location of such evidence carefully given in relation 
to both the measured boundary lines and those established by the 
record. An absence of notation on the survey shall be presumptive of 
no observable evidence of possession. 

12. The location of all buildings upon the plot or parcel shall be 
shown and their locations defined by measurements perpendicular to 
the boundaries. If there are no buildings, so state. Proper street 
numbers shall be shown where available.

INSTRUCTIONS TO ARCHITECT/ENGINEER AND INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE CONSULTANT 

SECTION 02 82 11 
CLASS I NEGATIVE PRESSURE ENCLOSURE ASBESTOS ABATEMENT SPECIFICATIONS 

 

1. These specifications provide general guidance to personnel given the 
task of designing and executing a Class I negative pressure 
enclosure asbestos abatement project. Each abatement is a unique 
situation and therefore must be tailored for that project. This 
specification incorporates current regulatory requirements and 
current best abatement practices, procedures and technology. The 
Architect/Engineer and/or the Industrial Hygiene consultants may 
provide additional specification additions or deletions to this 
specification that, in their professional judgment, will ensure a 
safe and effective approach to a specific abatement project while 
maintaining compliance with applicable regulations and VA policy. 
Any changes must be clearly marked on/attached to this document 
prior to finalization of the specification so that the changes will 
be adequately considered in the review process by the VA. 

2. These specifications are to be used in conjunction with asbestos 
abatement contractor selection criteria; special instructions 
package; and general construction provisions. 

3. Paragraphs that are not preceded by a number code are indented as 
instructions to the specifications writer and identified by the 
notation "Spec Writer Notes". These paragraphs must be deleted from 
the final document. 

4. Within the text of the specifications, there may be optional 
procedures which the specification writer could include in the final 
specification. Procedures which are not chosen must be deleted by 
the specification writer. Optional text is shown by the notation 
(//text//). 

5. The specification writer, VPIH/CIH, CPIH/CIH, and A/E must be aware 
of and read the VA A/E Quality Alert 07/09 since it details common 
errors in specification and contract documents for asbestos project. 
This would be especially helpful if a survey is being conducted 
prior to an abatement project. A full AHERA survey of the facility 
would be needed prior to renovation activities, however, if 
demolition of the facility is planned, a NESHAP survey of the 
facility would need to be performed. 

 

PART 1 - GENERAL 

1.1 SUMMARY OF THE WORK 

1.1.1 CONTRACT DOCUMENTS AND RELATED REQUIREMENTS 

 Drawings, general provisions of the contract, including general and 
supplementary conditions and other Division 01 specifications, shall 
apply to the work of this section. The contract documents show the work 
to be done under the contract and related requirements and conditions 
impacting the project. Related requirements and conditions include 
applicable codes and regulations, notices and permits, existing site 
conditions and restrictions on use of the site, requirements for 
partial owner occupancy during the work, coordination with other work 
and the phasing of the work. In the event the Asbestos Abatement 
Contractor discovers a conflict in the contract documents and/or 
requirements or codes, the conflict must be brought to the immediate 
attention of the Contracting Officer for resolution. Whenever there is 


a conflict or overlap in the requirements, the most stringent shall 
apply. Any actions taken by the Contractor without obtaining guidance 
from the Contracting Officer shall become the sole risk and 
responsibility of the Asbestos Abatement Contractor. All costs incurred 
due to such action are also the responsibility of the Asbestos 
Abatement Contractor. 

 

1.1.2 EXTENT OF WORK 

A. Below is a brief description of the estimated quantities of asbestos 
containing materials to be abated. These quantities are for 
informational purposes only and are based on the best information 
available at the time of the specification preparation. The Contractor 
shall satisfy himself as the actual quantities to be abated. Nothing in 
this section may be interpreted as limiting the extent of work 
otherwise required by this contract and related documents. 

 B. Removal, clean-up and disposal of asbestos containing materials (ACM) 
and asbestos/waste contaminated elements in an appropriate regulated 
area for the following approximate quantities; 

 

Bldg. 1 South (JLM) 

 (10,400) square feet of asbestos containing & non-asbestos containing 
floor tile and associated asbestos containing mastic located on the 
ground floor within the project area.

1.1.4 TASKS 

 The work tasks are summarized briefly as follows: 

A. Pre-abatement activities including pre-abatement meeting(s), 
inspection(s), notifications, permits, submittal approvals, regulated 
area preparations, emergency procedures arrangements, and standard 
operating procedures for asbestos abatement work. 


B. Abatement activities including removal, clean-up and disposal of ACM 
waste, recordkeeping, security, monitoring, and inspections. 

C. Cleaning and decontamination activities including final visual 
inspection, air monitoring and certification of decontamination. 

 

1.1.5 CONTRACTORS USE OF PREMISES 

A. The Contractor and Contractor's personnel shall cooperate fully with 
the VA representative/consultant to facilitate efficient use of 
buildings and areas within buildings. The Contractor shall perform the 
work in accordance with the VA specifications, drawings, phasing plan 
and in compliance with any/all applicable Federal, State and Local 
regulations and requirements. 

B. The Contractor shall use the existing facilities in the building 
strictly within the limits indicated in contract documents as well as 
the approved VA Design and Construction Procedures. VA Design and 
Construction Procedures drawings of partially occupied buildings will 
show the limits of regulated areas; the placement of decontamination 
facilities; the temporary location of bagged waste ACM; the path of 
transport to outside the building; and the temporary waste storage area 
for each building/regulated area. Any variation from the arrangements 
shown on drawings shall be secured in writing from the VA 
representative through the pre-abatement plan of action. The following 
limitations of use shall apply to existing facilities shown on 
drawings: 

 

1.2 VARIATIONS IN QUANTITY 

 The quantities and locations of ACM as indicated on the drawings and 
the extent of work included in this section are estimated which are 
limited by the physical constraints imposed by occupancy of the 
buildings and accessibility to ACM. Accordingly, minor variations (+/- 
5%) in quantities of ACM within the regulated area are considered as 
having no impact on contract price and time requirements of this 
contract. Where additional work is required beyond the above variation, 
the contractor shall provide unit prices for newly discovered ACM and 
those prices shall be used for additional work required under the 
contractor. Contractor should refer to "Differing Site Conditions"; 
(FAR 52.236-2) of Section 00 72 00, General Conditions.

2.2 MONITORING, INSPECTION AND TESTING 

2.2.1 GENERAL 

A. Perform throughout abatement work monitoring, inspection and testing 
inside and around the regulated area in accordance with the OSHA 
requirements and these specifications. OSHA requires that the employee 
exposure to asbestos must not exceed 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter 
(f/cc) of air, averaged over an 8-hour work shift. The CPIH/CIH is 
responsible for and shall inspect and oversee the performance of the 
Contractor IH Technician. The IH Technician shall continuously inspect 
and monitor conditions inside the regulated area to ensure compliance 
with these specifications. In addition, the CPIH/CIH shall personally 
manage air sample collection, analysis, and evaluation for personnel, 
regulated area, and adjacent area samples to satisfy OSHA requirements. 
Additional inspection and testing requirements are also indicated in 
other parts of this specification. 

B. The VA will employ an independent industrial hygienist (VPIH/CIH) 
consultant and/or use its own IH to perform various services on behalf 
of the VA. The VPIH/CIH will perform the necessary monitoring, 
inspection, testing, and other support services to ensure that VA 
patients, employees, and visitors will not be adversely affected by the 
abatement work, and that the abatement work proceeds in accordance with 
these specifications, that the abated areas or abated buildings have 
been successfully decontaminated. The work of the VPIH/CIH consultant 
in no way relieves the Contractor from their responsibility to perform 
the work in accordance with contract/specification requirements, to 
perform continuous inspection, monitoring and testing for the safety of 
their employees, and to perform other such services as specified. The 
cost of the VPIH/CIH and their services will be borne by the VA except 
for any repeat of final inspection and testing that may be required due 
to unsatisfactory initial results. Any repeated final inspections 
and/or testing, if required, will be paid for by the Contractor. 

C. If fibers counted by the VPIH/CIH during abatement work, either inside 
or outside the regulated area, utilizing the NIOSH 7400 air monitoring 
method, exceed the specified respective limits, the Contractor shall 
stop work. The Contractor may request confirmation of the results by 
analysis of the samples by TEM. Request must be in writing and 
submitted to the VA's representative. Cost for the confirmation of 
results will be borne by the Contractor for both the collection and 
analysis of samples and for the time delay that may/does result for 
this confirmation. Confirmation sampling and analysis will be the 
responsibility of the CPIH with review and approval of the VPIH/CIH. An 
agreement between the CPIH/CIH and the VPIH/CIH shall be reached on the 
exact details of the confirmation effort, in writing, including such 
things as the number of samples, location, collection, quality control 
on-site, analytical laboratory, interpretation of results and any 
follow-up actions. This written agreement shall be co-signed by the 
IH's and delivered to the VA's representative. 

 

2.2.2 SCOPE OF SERVICES OF THE VPIH/CIH CONSULTANT 

A. The purpose of the work of the VPIH/CIH is to: assure quality; 
adherence to the specification; resolve problems; prevent the spread of 
contamination beyond the regulated area; and assure clearance at the 
end of the project. In addition, their work includes performing the 
final inspection and testing to determine whether the regulated area or 
building has been adequately decontaminated. All air monitoring is to 


be done utilizing PCM/TEM. The VPIH/CIH will perform the following 
tasks: 

1. Task 1: Establish background levels before abatement begins by 
collecting background samples. Retain samples for possible TEM 
analysis. 

2. Task 2: Perform continuous air monitoring, inspection, and testing 
outside the regulated area during actual abatement work to detect 
any faults in the regulated area isolation and any adverse impact on 
the surroundings from regulated area activities. 

3. Task 3: Perform unannounced visits to spot check overall compliance 
of work with contract/specifications. These visits may include any 
inspection, monitoring, and testing inside and outside the regulated 
area and all aspects of the operation except personnel monitoring. 

4. Task 4: Provide support to the VA representative such as evaluation 
of submittals from the Contractor, resolution of conflicts, 
interpret data, etc. 

5. Task 5: Perform, in the presence of the VA representative, final 
inspection and testing of a decontaminated regulated area at the 
conclusion of the abatement to certify compliance with all 
regulations and VA requirements/specifications. 

6. Task 6: Issue certificate of decontamination for each regulated area 
and project report. 

 

B. All documentation, inspection results and testing results generated by 
the VPIH/CIH will be available to the Contractor for information and 
consideration. The Contractor shall cooperate with and support the 
VPIH/CIH for efficient and smooth performance of their work. 

C. The monitoring and inspection results of the VPIH/CIH will be used by 
the VA to issue any Stop Removal orders to the Contractor during 
abatement work and to accept or reject a regulated area or building as 
decontaminated.

too low of a pressure drop across filters. 

G. Negative Air Machine Electrical: All electrical components 
shall be approved by the National Electrical Manufacturer's 
Association (NEMA) and Underwriters Laboratories (UL). Each 
unit must be provided with overload protection and the motor, 
fan, fan housing, and cabinet must be grounded. 

H. It is essential that replacement HEPA filters be tested using 
an “in-line” testing method, to ensure the seal around the 
periphery was not damaged during replacement. Damage to the 
outer HEPA filter seal could allow contaminated air to bypass 
the HEPA filter and be discharged to an inappropriate 
location. Contractor will provide written documentation of 
test results for negative air machine units with HEPA filters 
changed by the contractor or documentation when changed and 
tested by the contractor filters 

 

3.1.3.3 PRESSURE DIFFERENTIAL 

The fully operational negative air system within the regulated 
area shall continuously maintain a pressure differential of - 
0.02" water column gauge. Before any disturbance of any asbestos 
material, this shall be demonstrated to the VA by use of a 
pressure differential meter/manometer as required by OSHA 29 CFR 
1926.1101(e)(5)(i). The Competent Person shall be responsible for 
providing, maintaining, and documenting the negative pressure and 
air changes as required by OSHA and this specification. 

 

3.1.3.4 MONITORING 

The pressure differential shall be continuously monitored and 
recorded between the regulated area and the area outside the 
regulated area with a monitoring device that incorporates a strip 
chart recorder. The strip chart recorder shall become part of the 
project log and shall indicate at least -0.02" water column gauge 
for the duration of the project. 

 

3.1.3.5 AUXILIARY GENERATOR 

If the building is occupied during abatement, provide an 
auxiliary gasoline/diesel generator located outside the 
building in an area protected from the weather. In the event 
of a power failure of the general power grid and the VAMC 
emergency power grid, the generator must automatically start 
and supply power to a minimum of 50% of the negative air 
machines in operation. 

 

3.1.3.6 SUPPLEMENTAL MAKE-UP AIR INLETS 

Provide, as needed for proper air flow in the regulated area, 
in a location approved by the VA, openings in the plastic 
sheeting to allow outside air to flow into the regulated area. 
Auxiliary makeup air inlets must be located as far from the 


negative air machines as possible, off the floor near the 
ceiling, and away from the barriers that separate the 
regulated area from the occupied clean areas. Cover the inlets 
with weighted flaps which will seal in the event of failure of 
the negative pressure system. 

 

3.1.3.7 TESTING THE SYSTEM 

The negative pressure system must be tested before any ACM is 
disturbed in any way. After the regulated area has been 
completely prepared, the decontamination units set up, and the 
negative air machines installed, start the units up one at a 
time. Demonstrate and document the operation and testing of 
the negative pressure system to the VA using smoke tubes and a 
negative pressure gauge. Verification and documentation of 
adequate negative pressure differential across each barrier 
must be done at the start of each work shift. 

 

3.1.3.8 DEMONSTRATION OF THE NEGATIVE PRESSURE FILTRATION 
SYSTEM 

The demonstration of the operation of the negative pressure 
system to the VA shall include, but not be limited to, the 
following: 

A. Plastic barriers and sheeting move lightly in toward the 
regulated area. 

B. Curtains of the decontamination units move in toward 
regulated area. 

C. There is a noticeable movement of air through the 
decontamination units. Use the smoke tube to demonstrate 
air movement from the clean room to the shower room to the 
equipment room to the regulated area. 

D. Use smoke tubes to demonstrate air is moving across all 
areas in which work is to be done. Use a differential 
pressure gauge to indicate a negative pressure of at least 
-0.02" across every barrier separating the regulated area 
from the rest of the building. Modify the system as 
necessary to meet the above requirements. 

 

3.1.3.9 USE OF THE NEGATIVE PRESSURE FILTRATION SYSTEM 
DURING ABATEMENT OPERATIONS 

A. Start units before beginning any disturbance of ACM occurs. 
After work begins, the units shall run continuously, 
maintaining 4 actual air changes per hour at a negative 
pressure differential of -0.02" water column gauge, for the 
duration of the work until a final visual clearance and 
final air clearance has been successfully completed. 

 No negative air units shall be shut down at any time unless 
authorized by the VA Contracting Officer, verbally and in 
writing. 

B. Pre-cleaning of ACM contaminated items shall be performed 
after the enclosure has been erected and negative pressure 
has been established in the work area. After items have 
been pre-cleaned and decontaminated, they may be removed 
from the work area for storage until the completion of 
abatement in the work area. 


C. Abatement work shall begin at a location farthest from the 
units and proceed towards them. If an electric failure 
occurs, the Competent Person shall stop all abatement work 
and immediately begin wetting all exposed asbestos 
materials for the duration of the power outage. Abatement 
work shall not resume until power is restored and all units 
are operating properly again. 

D. The negative air machines shall continue to run after all 
work is completed and until a final visual clearance and a 
final air clearance has been successfully completed for 
that regulated area. 

 

3.1.3.10 DISMANTLING THE SYSTEM 

After completion of the final visual and final air clearance 
has been obtained by the VPIH/CIH, the units may be shut down. 
The unit exterior surfaces shall have been completely 
decontaminated; pre-filters are not to be removed and the 
units inlet/outlet sealed with 2 layers of 6 mil poly 
immediately after shut down. No filter removal shall occur at 
the VA site following successful completion of site clearance. 
OSHA/EPA/DOT asbestos shall be attached to the units. 

 

3.1.4 CONTAINMENT BARRIERS AND COVERINGS IN THE REGULATED AREA 

3.1.4.1 GENERAL 

Seal off the perimeter to the regulated area to completely 
isolate the regulated area from adjacent spaces. All surfaces 
in the regulated area must be covered to prevent contamination 
and to facilitate clean-up. Should adjacent areas become 
contaminated as a result of the work, shall immediately stop 
work and clean up the contamination at no additional cost to 
the VA. Provide firestopping and identify all fire barrier 
penetrations due to abatement work as specified in Section 
3.1.4.8; FIRESTOPPING. 

 

3.1.4.2 PREPARATION PRIOR TO SEALING THE REGULATED AREA

regulated area before commencing work. Any objects remaining 
in the regulated area shall be completely covered with 2 
layers of 6-mil fire retardant poly sheeting and secured with 
duct tape. Lock out and tag out any HVAC/electrical systems in 
the regulated area. 

 

3.1.4.3 CONTROLLING ACCESS TO THE REGULATED AREA 

Access to the regulated area is allowed only through the 
personnel decontamination facility (PDF). All other means of 
access shall be eliminated and OSHA DANGER demarcation signs 
posted as required by OSHA. If the regulated area is adjacent 
to, or within view of an occupied area, provide a visual 
barrier of 6 mil opaque fire retardant poly to prevent 
building occupant observation. If the adjacent area is 


accessible to the public, the barrier must be solid and 
capable of withstanding the negative pressure. 

 

3.1.4.4 CRITICAL BARRIERS 

 Completely separate any operations in the regulated area 
from adjacent areas using 2 layers of 6 mil fire retardant 
poly and duct tape. Individually seal with 2 layers of 6 mil 
poly and duct tape all HVAC openings into the regulated area. 
Individually seal all lighting fixtures, clocks, doors, 
windows, convectors, speakers, or any other objects/openings 
in the regulated area. Heat must be shut off any objects 
covered with poly. 

 

3.1.4.5 PRIMARY BARRIERS 

A. Cover the regulated area with two layers of 6 mil fire 
retardant poly on the floors and two layers of 4 mil, fire 
retardant poly on the walls, unless otherwise directed in 
writing by the VA representative. Floor layers must form a 
right angle with the wall and turn up the wall at least 300 
mm (12"). Seams must overlap at least 1800 mm (6') and must 
be spray glued and taped. Install sheeting so that layers 
can be removed independently from each other. Carpeting 
shall be covered with three layers of 6 mil poly. 
Corrugated cardboard sheets must be placed between the 
bottom and middle layers of poly. Mechanically support and 
seal with duct tape and glue all wall layers. 

 

B. If stairs and ramps are covered with 6 mil plastic, two 
layers must be used. Provide 19 mm (3/4") exterior grade 
plywood treads held in place with duct tape/glue on the 
plastic. Do not cover rungs or rails with any isolation 
materials. 

 

3.1.4.6 SECONDARY BARRIERS 

A loose layer of 6 mil shall be used as a drop cloth to 
protect the primary layers from debris generated during the 
abatement. This layer shall be replaced as needed during the 
work and at a minimum once per work day. 

 

3.1.4.7 EXTENSION OF THE REGULATED AREA 

If the enclosure of the regulated area is breached in any way 
that could allow contamination to occur, the affected area 
shall be included in the regulated area and constructed as per 
this section. Decontamination measures must be started 
immediately and continue until air monitoring indicates 
background levels are met. 

3.1.4.8 FIRESTOPPING 

A. Through penetrations caused by cables, cable trays, pipes, 
sleeves, conduits, etc. must be firestopped with a firerated 
firestop system providing an air tight seal. 

B. Firestop materials that are not equal to the wall or 
ceiling penetrated shall be brought to the attention of the 


VA Representative. The contractor shall list all areas of 
penetration, the type of sealant used, and whether or not 
the location is fire rated. Any discovery of penetrations 
during abatement shall be brought to the attention of the 
VA representative immediately. All walls, floors and 
ceilings are considered fire rated unless otherwise 
determined by the VA Representative or Fire Marshall. 

C. Any visible openings whether or not caused by a penetration 
shall be reported by the Contractor to the VA 
Representative for a sealant system determination. 
Firestops shall meet ASTM E814 and UL 1479 requirements for 
the opening size, penetrant, and fire rating needed. 

 

3.1.5 SANITARY FACILITIES 

The Contractor shall provide sanitary facilities for abatement 
personnel and maintain them in a clean and sanitary condition 
throughout the abatement project. 

 

3.1.6 PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 

Provide whole body clothing, head coverings, gloves and foot coverings 
and any other personal protective equipment as determined by conducting 
the hazard assessment required by OSHA at 29 CFR 1910.132 (d). The 
Competent Person shall ensure the integrity of personal protective 
equipment worn for the duration of the project. Duct tape shall be used 
to secure all suit sleeves to wrists and to secure foot coverings at 
the ankle. 

 

3.1.7 PRE-CLEANING 

 

The VA will provide water for abatement purposes. The Contractor shall 
connect to the existing VA system. The service to the shower(s) shall 
be supplied with backflow prevention. 

 

Pre-cleaning of ACM contaminated items shall be performed after the 
enclosure has been erected and negative pressure has been established 
in the work area. All workers performing pre-cleaning activities must 
don appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), as specified 
throughout this document and as approved in the Contractor’s work plan. 
After items have been pre-cleaned and decontaminated, they may be 
removed from the work area for storage until the completion of 
abatement in the work area. 

 

Pre-clean all movable objects within the regulated area using a HEPA 
filtered vacuum and/or wet cleaning methods as appropriate. After 
cleaning, these objects shall be removed from the regulated area and 
carefully stored in an uncontaminated location. Drapes, clothing, 
upholstered furniture and other fabric items should be disposed of as 
asbestos contaminated waste. Cleaning these asbestos contaminated items 
utilizing HEPA vacuum techniques and off-premises steam cleaning is 
very difficult and cannot guarantee decontamination. Carpeting will be 
disposed of prior to abatement if in the regulated area. If ACM floor 
tile is attached to the carpet while the Contractor is removing the 
carpet that section of the carpet will be disposed of as asbestos 
waste. The pre-cleaning shall be completed by the Contractor. 

 


Pre-clean all fixed objects in the regulated area using HEPA filtered 
vacuums and/or wet cleaning techniques as appropriate. Careful 
attention must be paid to machinery behind grills or gratings where 
access may be difficult but contamination may be significant. Also, pay 
particular attention to wall, floor and ceiling penetration behind 
fixed items. After pre-cleaning, enclose fixed objects with 2 layers of 
6-mil poly and seal securely in place with duct tape. Objects (e.g., 
permanent fixtures, shelves, electronic equipment, laboratory tables, 
sprinklers, alarm systems, closed circuit TV equipment and computer 
cables) which must remain in the regulated area and that require 
special ventilation or enclosure requirements should be designated here 
along with specified means of protection. Contact the manufacturer for 
special protection requirements. 

Control panels, gauges etc., in the regulated area may require VA 
access during abatement. These shall be designated by the VA 
representative and enclosures constructed by the Contractor, with 
access flaps sealed with waterproof tape. 

 

Pre-clean all surfaces in the regulated area using HEPA filtered 
vacuums and/or wet cleaning methods as appropriate. Do not use any 
methods that would raise dust such as dry sweeping or vacuuming with 
equipment not equipped with HEPA filters. Do not disturb asbestoscontaining 
materials during this pre-cleaning phase. Pre-cleaning shall 
be completed by the Contractor. 

 

3.1.8 PRE-ABATEMENT ACTIVITIES 

3.1.8.1 PRE-ABATEMENT MEETING 

The VA representative, upon receipt, review, and substantial 
approval of all pre-abatement submittals and verification by the 
CPIH/CIH that all materials and equipment required for the 
project are on the site, will arrange for a pre-abatement meeting 
between the Contractor, the CPIH/CIH, Competent Person(s), the VA 
representative(s), and the VPIH/CIH. The purpose of the meeting 
is to discuss any aspect of the submittals needing clarification 
or amplification and to discuss any aspect of the project 
execution and the sequence of the operation. The Contractor shall 
be prepared to provide any supplemental information/documentation 
to the VA's representative regarding any submittals, 
documentation, materials or equipment. Upon satisfactory 
resolution of any outstanding issues, the VA's representative 
will issue a written order to proceed to the Contractor. No 
abatement work of any kind described in the following provisions 
shall be initiated prior to the VA written order to proceed. 

 

3.1.8.2 PRE-ABATEMENT CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATIONS 

A. Perform all preparatory work for the first regulated area 
in accordance with the approved work schedule and with this 
specification. 

B. Upon completion of all preparatory work, the CPIH/CIH will 
inspect the work and systems and will notify the VA's 
representative when the work is completed in accordance 
with this specification. The VA's representative may 
inspect the regulated area and the systems with the 
VPIH/CIH and may require that upon satisfactory inspection, 
the Contractor's employees perform all major aspects of the 


approved AHAP(s), especially worker protection, respiratory 
systems, contingency plans, decontamination procedures, and 
monitoring to demonstrate satisfactory operation. The 
operational systems for respiratory protection and the 
negative pressure system shall be demonstrated for proper 
performance. 

C. The CPIH/CIH shall document the pre-abatement activities 
described above and deliver a copy to the VA's 
representative. 

D. Upon satisfactory inspection of the installation of and 
operation of systems the VA's representative will notify 
the Contractor in writing to proceed with the asbestos 
abatement work in accordance with this specification and 
all applicable regulations. 

 

3.1.8.3 PRE-ABATEMENT INSPECTIONS AND PREPARATIONS 

Before any work begins on the construction of the regulated area, 
the Contractor will: 

A. Conduct a space-by-space inspection with an authorized VA 
representative and prepare a written inventory of all 
existing damage in those spaces where asbestos abatement 
will occur. Still or video photography may be used to 
supplement the written damage inventory. Document will be 
signed and certified as accurate by both parties. 

B. The VA Representative, the Contractor, and the VPIH/CIH 
must be aware of VA A/E Quality Alert 07/09 indicating the 
failure to identify asbestos in the areas listed as well as 
common issues when preparing specifications and contract 
documents. This is especially critical when demolition is 
planned, because AHERA surveys are non-destructive, and ACM 
may remain undetected. A NESHAPS (destructive) ACM 
inspection should be conducted on all building structures 
that will be demolished. Ensure the following areas are 
inspected on the project: lay-in ceilings concealing ACM; 
ACM behind walls/windows from previous renovations; inside 
utility chases/walls; transite piping/ductwork/sheets; 
behind radiators; lab fume hoods; transite lab countertops; 
roofing materials; below window sills; water/sewer lines; 
electrical conduit coverings; crawlspaces (previous 
abatement contamination); flooring/mastic covered by 
carpeting/new flooring; exterior insulated wall panels; on 
underground fuel tanks; and steam line trench coverings. 

C. Ensure that all furniture, machinery, equipment, curtains, 
drapes, blinds, and other movable objects required to be 
removed from the regulated area have been cleaned and 
removed or properly protected from contamination. The VA 
shall be responsible for moving all items listed in the 
section. 

D. If present and required, remove and dispose of carpeting 
from floors in the regulated area. 

E. Inspect existing firestopping in the regulated area. 
Correct as needed. 


 

3.2 REMOVAL OF ACM 

3.2.1 WETTING ACM 

A. Use amended water for the wetting of ACM prior to removal. The 
Competent Person shall assure the wetting of ACM meets the definition 
of "adequately wet" in the EPA NESHAP regulation and OSHA’s “wet 
methods” for the duration of the project. A removal encapsulant may be 
used instead of amended water with written approval of the VA's 
representative. 

B. Amended Water: Provide water to which a surfactant has been added shall 
be used to wet the ACM and reduce the potential for fiber release 
during disturbance of ACM. The mixture must be equal to or greater than 
the wetting provided by water amended by a surfactant consisting one 
ounce of 50% polyoxyethylene ester and 50% polyoxyethylene ether mixed 
with 5 gallons (19L) of water. 

C. Removal Encapsulant: When authorized by VA, provide a penetrating 
encapsulant designed specifically for the removal of ACM. The material 
must, when used, result in adequate wetting of the ACM and retard fiber 
release during removal. 

 

3.2.2 SECONDARY BARRIER AND WALKWAYS 

A. Install as a drop cloth a 6 mil poly sheet at the beginning of each 
work shift where removal is to be done during that shift. Completely 
cover floors and any walls within 10 feet (3 meters) of the area where 
work is to done. Secure the secondary barrier with duct tape to prevent 
it from moving or debris from getting behind it. Remove the secondary 
barrier at the end of the shift or as work in the area is completed. 
Keep residue on the secondary barrier wetted. When removing, fold 
inward to prevent spillage and place in a disposal bag. 

B. Install walkways using 6 mil black poly between the regulated area and 
the decontamination facilities (PDF and W/EDF) to protect the primary 
layers from contamination and damage. Install the walkways at the 
beginning of each shift and remove at the end of each shift. 

 

3.2.3 WET REMOVAL OF ACM 

A. Adequately and thoroughly wet the ACM to be removed prior to removal 
with amended water or when authorized by VA, removal encapsulant to 
reduce/prevent fiber release to the air. Adequate time (at a minimum 
two hours) must be allowed for the amended water or removal encapsulant 
to saturate the ACM. Abatement personnel must not disturb dry ACM. Use 
a fine spray of amended water or removal encapsulant. Saturate the 
material sufficiently to wet to the substrate without causing excessive 
dripping. The material must be sprayed repeatedly/continuously during 
the removal process in order to maintain adequately wet conditions. 
Removal encapsulants must be applied in accordance with the 
manufacturer's written instructions. Perforate or carefully separate, 
using wet methods, an outer covering that is painted or jacketed in 
order to allow penetration and wetting of the material. Where 
necessary, carefully remove covering while wetting to minimize fiber 
release. In no event shall dry removal occur except when authorized in 
writing by the VPIH/CIH and VA when a greater safety hazard (e.g., 
electricity) is present. 

 


B. If ACM does not wet well with amended water due to composition, coating 
or jacketing, remove as follows: 

1. Mist work area continuously with amended water whenever necessary to 
reduce airborne fiber levels. 

2. Remove saturated ACM in small sections. Do not allow material to dry 
out. As material is removed, bag material, while still wet into 
disposal bags. Twist the bag neck tightly, bend over (gooseneck) and 
seal with a minimum of three tight wraps of duct tape. Clean 
/decontaminate the outside of the bag of any residue and move to 
washdown station adjacent to W/EDF. 

3. Fireproofing or Architectural Finish on Scratch Coat: Spray with a 
fine mist of amended water or removal encapsulant. Allow time for 
saturation to the substrate. Do not over saturate causing excess 
dripping. Scrape material from substrate. Remove material in 
manageable quantities and control falling to staging or floor. If 
the falling distance is over 20 feet (6M), use a drop chute to 
contain material through descent. Remove residue remaining on the 
scratch coat after scraping is done using a stiff bristle hand 
brush. If a removal encapsulant is used, remove residue completely 
before the encapsulant dries. Periodically re-wet the substrate with 
amended water as needed to prevent drying of the material before the 
residue is removed from the substrate. 

4. Fireproofing or Architectural Finish on Wire Lath: Spray with a fine 
mist of amended water or removal encapsulant. Allow time to 
completely saturate the material. Do not over saturate causing 
excess dripping. If the surface has been painted or otherwise 
coated, cut small holes as needed and apply amended water or removal 
encapsulant from above. Cut saturated wire lath into 2' x 6' (50mm x 
150mm) sections and cut hanger wires. Roll up complete with ACM, 
cover in burlap and hand place in disposal bag. Do not drop to 
floor. After removal of lath/ACM, remove any overspray on decking 
and structure using stiff bristle nylon brushes. Depending on 
hardness of overspray, scrapers may be needed for removal. 

5. Pipe/Tank/Vessel/Boiler Insulation: Remove the outer layer of wrap 
while spraying with amended water in order to saturate the ACM. 
Spray ACM with a fine mist of amended water or removal encapsulant. 
Allow time to saturate the material to the substrate. Cut bands 
holding pre-formed pipe insulation sections. Slit jacketing at the 
seams, remove and hand place in a disposal bag. Do not allow 
dropping to the floor. Remove molded fitting insulation/mud in large 
pieces and hand place in a disposal bag. Remove any residue on pipe 
or fitting with a stiff bristle nylon brush. In locations where pipe 
fitting insulation is removed from fibrous glass or other nonasbestos 
insulated straight runs of pipe, remove fibrous material at 
least 6" from the point it contacts the ACM. 

 

 

3.2.4 WET REMOVAL OF AMOSITE 

A. Should areas of amosite ACM be located during the course of demolition 
/renovation, these areas will require local exhaust ventilation and 
collection as described below, in addition to wet removal. Provide 
specific description /locations/ drawings. 

B. Provide local exhaust ventilation and collection systems to assure 
collection of amosite fibers at the point of generation. A 300 mm (12") 
flexible rigid non-collapsing duct shall be shall be located no more 
than 600 mm (2') from any scraping/brushing activity. Primary filters 


must be replaced every 30 minutes on the negative air machines. Each 
scraping/brushing activity must have a negative air machine devoted to 
it. For pre-molded pipe insulation or cutting wire lathe attach a 1200 
mm (4') square flared end piece on the intake of the duct. Support the 
duct horizontally at a point 600 mm (2') below the work to effect 
capture. One person in the crew shall be assigned to operate the duct 
collection system on a continual basis. 

C. Amosite does not wet well with amended water. Submit full 
information/documentation on the wetting agent proposed prior to start 
for review and approval by the VPIH/CIH and VA Contracting Officer. 
Insure that the material is worked on in small sections and is 
thoroughly and continuously wetted. Package as soon as possible while 
wet. Remove as required. 

 

3.3 LOCKDOWN ENCAPSULATION 

3.3.1 GENERAL 

 Lockdown encapsulation is an integral part of the ACM removal. At the 
conclusion of ACM removal and before removal of the primary barriers, 
the contractor shall encapsulate all surfaces with a bridging 
encapsulant. 

 

3.3.2 DELIVERY AND STORAGE 

 Deliver materials to the job site in original, new and unopened 
containers bearing the manufacturer's name and label as well as the 
following information: name of material, manufacturer's stock number, 
date of manufacture, thinning instructions, application instructions 
and the MSDS for the material. 

 

3.3.3 WORKER PROTECTION 

 Before beginning work with any material for which an MSDS has been 
submitted, provide workers with any required personal protective 
equipment. The required personal protective equipment shall be used 
whenever exposure to the material might occur. In addition to 
OSHA/specification requirements for respiratory protection, a paint 
pre-filter and an organic vapor cartridge, at a minimum, shall used in 
addition to the HEPA filter when an organic solvent based encapsulant 
is used. The CPIH/CIH shall be responsible for provision of adequate 
respiratory protection. Note: Flammable and combustible encapsulants 
shall not be used, unless authorized in writing by the VA. 

 

 

3.3.4 ENCAPSULATION OF SCRATCH COAT PLASTER OR PIPING 

A. Apply two coats of lockdown encapsulant to the scratch coat plaster or 
piping after all ACM has been removed. Apply in strict accordance with 
the manufacturer's instructions. Any deviation from the instructions 
must be approved by the VA's representative in writing prior to 
commencing the work. 

B. Apply the lockdown encapsulant with an airless sprayer at a pressure 
and using a nozzle orifice as recommended by the manufacturer. Apply 
the first coat while the while the scratch coat is still damp from the 
asbestos removal process, after passing the visual inspection. If the 
surface has been allowed to dry, wet wipe or HEPA vacuum prior to 
spraying with encapsulant. Apply a second coat over the first coat in 
strict conformance with the manufacturer's instructions. Color the 


lockdown encapsulant and contrast the color in the second coat so that 
visual confirmation of completeness and uniform coverage of each coat 
is possible. Adhere to the manufacturer's instructions for coloring. At 
the completion of the encapsulation, the surface must be a uniform 
third color produced by the mixture. 

 

3.3.5 SEALING EXPOSED EDGES 

 Seal edges of ACM exposed by removal work which is inaccessible, such 
as a sleeve, wall penetration, etc., with two coats of bridging 
encapsulant. Prior to sealing, permit the exposed edges to dry 
completely to permit penetration of the bridging encapsulant. Apply in 
accordance with 3.3.4 (B). 

 

3.4 DISPOSAL OF ACM WASTE MATERIALS 

3.4.1 GENERAL 

 Dispose of waste ACM and debris which is packaged in accordance with 
these specifications, OSHA, EPA and DOT. The landfill requirements for 
packaging must also be met. Transport will be in compliance with 49 CFR 
100–185 regulations. Disposal shall be done at an approved landfill. 
Disposal of non-friable ACM shall be done in accordance with applicable 
regulations. 

 

3.4.2 PROCEDURES 

A. The VA must be notified at least 24 hours in advance of any waste 
removed from the containment. 

B. Asbestos waste shall be packaged and moved through the W/EDF into a 
covered transport container in accordance with procedures is this 
specification. Waste shall be double-bagged and wetted with amended 
water prior to disposal. Wetted waste can be very heavy. Bags shall 
not be overfilled. Bags shall be securely sealed to prevent accidental 
opening and/or leakage. The top shall be tightly twisted and goose 
necked prior to tightly sealing with at least three wraps of duct tape. 
Ensure that unauthorized persons do not have access to the waste 
material once it is outside the regulated area. All transport 
containers must be covered at all times when not in use. NESHAP signs 
must be on containers during loading and unloading. Material shall not 
be transported in open vehicles. If drums are used for packaging, the 
drums shall be labeled properly and shall not be re-used. 

C. Waste Load Out: Waste load out shall be done in accordance with the 
procedures in W/EDF Decontamination Procedures. Sealed waste bags shall 
be decontaminated on exterior surfaces by wet cleaning and/or HEPA 
vacuuming before being placed in the second waste bag and sealed, which 
then must also be wet wiped or HEPA vacuumed. 
D. Asbestos waste with sharp edged components, i.e., nails, screws, lath, 
strapping, tin sheeting, jacketing, metal mesh, etc., which might tear 
poly bags shall be wrapped securely in burlap before packaging and, if 
needed, use a poly lined fiber drum as the second container, prior to 
disposal. 


 

3.5 PROJECT DECONTAMINATION 

3.5.1 GENERAL 

A. The entire work related to project decontamination shall be performed 
under the close supervision and monitoring of the CPIH/CIH. 


B. If the asbestos abatement work is in an area which was contaminated 
prior to the start of abatement, the decontamination will be done by 
cleaning the primary barrier poly prior to its removal and cleanings of 
the surfaces of the regulated area after the primary barrier removal. 

C. If the asbestos abatement work is in an area which was uncontaminated 
prior to the start of abatement, the decontamination will be done by 
cleaning the primary barrier poly prior to its removal, thus preventing 
contamination of the building when the regulated area critical barriers 
are removed. 

 

3.5.2 REGULATED AREA CLEARANCE 

 Clearance air testing and other requirements which must be met before 
release of the Contractor and re-occupancy of the regulated area space 
are specified in Final Testing Procedures. 

 

3.5.3 WORK DESCRIPTION 

 Decontamination includes the clearance air testing in the regulated 
area and the decontamination and removal of the enclosures/facilities 
installed prior to the abatement work including primary/critical 
barriers, PDF and W/EDF facilities, and negative pressure systems. 

 

3.5.4 PRE-DECONTAMINATION CONDITIONS 

A. Before decontamination starts, all ACM waste from the regulated area 
shall be collected and removed, and the loose 6 mil layer of poly 
removed while being adequately wetted with amended water and disposed 
of along with any gross debris generated by the work. 

B. At the start of decontamination, the following shall be in place: 

1. Primary barriers consisting of 2 layers of 6 mil poly on the floor 
and 4 mil poly on the walls. 

2. Critical barriers consisting of 2 layers of 6 mil poly which is the 
sole barrier between the regulated area and openings to the rest of 
the building or outside. 

4. Decontamination facilities for personnel and equipment in operating 
condition and the negative pressure system in operation. 

 

3.5.5 FIRST CLEANING 

 Carry out a first cleaning of all surfaces of the regulated area 
including items of remaining poly sheeting, tools, scaffolding, 
ladders/staging by wet methods and/or HEPA vacuuming. Do not use dry 
dusting/sweeping/air blowing methods. Use each surface of a wetted 
cleaning cloth one time only and then dispose of as contaminated waste. 
Continue this cleaning until there is no visible residue from abated 
surfaces or poly or other surfaces. Remove all filters in the air 
handling system and dispose of as ACM waste in accordance with these 
specifications. The negative pressure system shall remain in operation 
during this time. Additional cleaning(s) may be needed as determined by 
the CPIH/VPIH/CIH. 

 

3.5.6 PRE-CLEARANCE INSPECTION AND TESTING 

 The CPIH/CIH and VPIH/CIH will perform a thorough and detailed visual 
inspection at the end of the cleaning to determine whether there is any 
visible residue in the regulated area. If the visual inspection is 
acceptable, the CPIH/CIH will perform pre-clearance sampling using 
aggressive clearance as detailed in 40 CFR 763 Subpart E (AHERA) 


Appendix A (III)(B)(7)(d). If the sampling results show values below 
0.01 f/cc, then the Contractor shall notify the VA's representative of 
the results with a brief report from the CPIH/CIH documenting the 
inspection and sampling results and a statement verifying that the 
regulated area is ready for lockdown encapsulation. The VA reserves the 
right to utilize their own VPIH/CIH to perform a pre-clearance 
inspection and testing for verification. 

 

3.5.7 LOCKDOWN ENCAPSULATION OF ABATED SURFACES 

 With the express written permission of the VA's representative, perform 
lockdown encapsulation of all surfaces from which asbestos was abated 
in accordance with the procedures in this specification. Negative 
pressure shall be maintained in the regulated area during the lockdown 
application. 

 

3.6 FINAL VISUAL INSPECTION AND AIR CLEARANCE TESTING 

3.6.1 GENERAL 

 Notify the VA representative 24 hours in advance for the performance of 
the final visual inspection and testing. The final visual inspection 
and testing will be performed by the VPIH/CIH starting after the final 
cleaning. 

 

3.6.2 FINAL VISUAL INSPECTION 

 Final visual inspection will include the entire regulated area, the 
PDF, all poly sheeting, seals over HVAC openings, doorways, windows, 
and any other openings. If any debris, residue, dust or any other 
suspect material is detected, the final cleaning shall be repeated at 
no cost to the VA. Dust/material samples may be collected and analyzed 
at no cost to the VA at the discretion of the VPIH/CIH to confirm 
visual findings. When the regulated area is visually clean the final 
testing can be done. 

 

3.6.3 FINAL AIR CLEARANCE TESTING 

A. After an acceptable final visual inspection by the VPIH/CIH and VA 
Representative, the VPIH/CIH will perform the final clearance testing. 
Air samples will be collected and analyzed in accordance with 
procedures for AHERA in this specification. If work is less than 260 
lf/160 sf/35 cf, 5 PCM samples shall be collected for clearance and a 
minimum of one field blank. If work is equal to or more than 260 lf/160 
sf/35 cf, AHERA TEM sampling shall be performed for clearance. TEM 
analysis shall be done in accordance with procedures for EPA AHERA in 
this specification. If the release criteria are not met, the Contractor 
shall repeat the final cleaning and continue decontamination procedures 
until clearance is achieved. All Additional inspection and testing 
costs will be borne by the Contractor. 

B. If release criteria are met, proceed to perform the abatement closeout 
and to issue the certificate of completion in accordance with these 
specifications. 

 

3.6.4 FINAL AIR CLEARANCE PROCEDURES 

A. Contractor's Release Criteria: Work in a regulated area is complete 
when the regulated area is visually clean and airborne fiber levels 
have been reduced to or below 0.01 f/cc as measured by the AHERA PCM 



protocol, or 70 AHERA structures per square millimeter (s/mm2) by AHERA 
TEM. 


B. Air Monitoring and Final Clearance Sampling: To determine if the 
elevated airborne fiber counts encountered during abatement operations 
have been reduced to the specified level, the VPIH/CIH will secure 
samples and analyze them according to the following procedures: 

1. Fibers Counted: “Fibers” referred to in this section shall be either 
all fibers regardless of composition as counted in the NIOSH 7400 
PCM method or asbestos fibers counted using the AHERA TEM method. 
2. Aggressive Sampling: All final air testing samples shall be 
collected using aggressive sampling techniques except where soil is 
not encapsulated or enclosed. Samples will be collected on 0.8. MCE 
filters for PCM analysis and 0.45. Polycarbonate filters for TEM. A 
minimum of 1200 Liters of using calibrated pumps shall be collected 
for clearance samples. Before pumps are started, initiate aggressive 
air mixing sampling as detailed in 40 CFR 763 Subpart E (AHERA) 
Appendix A (III)(B)(7)(d). Air samples will be collected in areas 
subject to normal air circulation away from corners, obstructed 
locations, and locations near windows, doors, or vents. After air 
sampling pumps have been shut off, circulating fans shall be shut 
off. The negative pressure system shall continue to operate. 
3. Final clearance for soil that is not encapsulated, samples will be 
collected on 0.8µ MCE filters for PCM analysis and 0.45µ 
Polycarbonate filters for TEM. A minimum of 1200 Liters of using 
calibrated pumps shall be collected for clearance samples. Air 
clearance of work areas where contaminated soil has been removed is 
in addition to the requirement for clearance by bulk sample analysis 
discussed within these specifications. There will be no aggressive 
air sampling for the clearance of soil due to the fact that 
aggressive air sampling may overload the cassettes. 
4. Random samples shall be collected from areas of soil which have been 
abated to ensure that the soil has been properly decontaminated. 
The total number of samples to be collected from the soil areas 
shall be; <1000 SF of soil – 3 samples; >1000 to <5000 SF of soil – 
5 samples; and >5000 SF of soil – 7 samples. The soil samples shall 
be collected in a statistically random manner and shall be analyzed 
by PLM method. The clearance level to determine the soil clean is 
<1% asbestos by weight as analyzed by PLM method. If this level is 
achieved, the soil areas shall be considered clear. If the levels 
are >1% asbestos, the areas shall be re-cleaned until the sample 
results are <1%. 


 

3.6.5 CLEARANCE SAMPLING USING PCM – LESS THAN 260LF/160SF: 

A. The VPIH/CIH will perform clearance samples as indicated by the 
specification. 

B. The NIOSH 7400 PCM method will be used for clearance sampling with a 
minimum collection volume of 1200 Liters of air. A minimum of 5 PCM 
clearance samples shall be collected. All samples must be equal to or 
less than 0.01 f/cc to clear the regulated area. 

C. Random samples shall be collected from areas of soil which have been 
abated to ensure that the soil has been properly decontaminated. The 
total number of samples to be collected from the soil areas shall be; 
<1000 SF of soil – 3 samples; >1000 to <5000 SF of soil – 5 samples; 
and >5000 SF of soil – 7 samples. The soil samples shall be collected 
in a statistically random manner and shall be analyzed by PLM method. 
The clearance level to determine the soil clean is <1% asbestos by 


weight as analyzed by PLM method. If this level is achieved, the soil 
areas shall be considered clear. If the levels are >1% asbestos, the 
areas shall be re-cleaned until the sample results are <1%. 

 

3.6.6 CLEARANCE SAMPLING USING TEM – EQUAL TO OR MORE THAN 260LF/160SF: TEM 

 A. Clearance requires 13 samples be collected; 5 inside the regulated 
area; 5 outside the regulated area; and 3 field blanks. 

 B. The PCM method will be used for clearance sampling with a minimum 
collection volume of 1200 Liters of air. A minimum of 13 clearance 
samples shall be collected. 

 

3.6.7 LABORATORY TESTING OF PCM CLEARANCE SAMPLES 
The services of an AIHA accredited laboratory will be employed by the 
VA to perform analysis for the PCM air samples. The accredited 
laboratory shall be successfully participating in the AIHA Proficiency 
Analytical Testing (PAT) program. Samples will be sent daily by the 
VPIH/CIH so that verbal/faxed reports can be received within 24 hours. 
A complete record, certified by the laboratory, of all air monitoring 
tests and results will be furnished to the VA’s representative and the 
Contractor. 

 

3.6.8 LABORATORY TESTING OF TEM SAMPLES 

 Samples shall be sent by the VPIH/CIH to a NIST accredited laboratory 
for analysis by TEM. The laboratory shall be successfully participating 
in the NIST Airborne Asbestos Analysis (TEM) program. Verbal/faxed 
results from the laboratory shall be available within 24 hours after 
receipt of the samples. A complete record, certified by the laboratory, 
of all TEM results shall be furnished to the VA's representative and 
the Contractor. 

 

 

 

 

3.6.9 LABORATORY TESTING OF BULK SAMPLES 

 

 Samples shall be sent by the VPIH/CIH or CPIH/CIH to a NIST accredited 
laboratory for analysis by PLM. The laboratory shall be successfully 
participating in the NIST Bulk Asbestos Analysis (PLM) program.

3.5 PROJECT DECONTAMINATION 

3.5.1 GENERAL 

 

A. The entire work related to project decontamination shall be performed 
under the close supervision and monitoring of the CPIH/CIH. 

B. If the asbestos abatement work is in an area which was contaminated 
prior to the start of abatement, the decontamination will be done by 
cleaning the primary barrier poly prior to its removal and cleanings of 
the surfaces of the regulated area after the primary barrier removal. 

C. If the asbestos abatement work is in an area which was uncontaminated 
prior to the start of abatement, the decontamination will be done by 
cleaning the primary barrier poly prior to its removal, thus preventing 
contamination of the building when the regulated area critical barriers 
are removed. 

 

3.5.2 REGULATED AREA CLEARANCE 

 Air testing and other requirements which must be met before release of 
the Contractor and re-occupancy of the regulated area space are 
specified in Final Testing Procedures. 

 

3.5.3 WORK DESCRIPTION 

 Decontamination includes the clearance air testing in the regulated 
area and the decontamination and removal of the enclosures/facilities 
installed prior to the abatement work including primary/critical 
barriers, PDF and W/EDF facilities, and negative pressure systems. 

 

3.5.4 PRE-DECONTAMINATION CONDITIONS 

A. Before decontamination starts, all ACM waste from the regulated area 
shall be removed, all waste collected and removed, and the secondary 
barrier of poly removed and disposed of along with any gross debris 
generated by the work. 

B. At the start of decontamination, the following shall be in place: 

1. Critical barriers over all openings consisting of two layers of 6 
mil poly which is the sole barrier between the regulated area and 
the rest of the building or outside. 

2. Decontamination facilities, if required for personnel and equipment 
in operating condition. 

 


3.5.5 CLEANING: 

 Clean all surfaces of the regulated area by wet methods and/or HEPA 
vacuuming. Do not use dry dusting/sweeping/air blowing methods. The 
negative pressure system shall remain in operation during this time. 
Additional cleaning(s) may be needed as determined by the 
CPIH/VPIH/CIH. 

 

3.6 VISUAL INSPECTION AND AIR CLEARANCE TESTING 

3.6.1 GENERAL 

 Notify the VA representative 24 hours in advance for the performance of 
the final visual inspection and testing. The final visual inspection 
and testing will be performed by the VPIH/CIH after the final cleaning. 

 

3.6.2 VISUAL INSPECTION 

 Final visual inspection will include the entire regulated area, the 
PDF, all poly sheeting, seals over HVAC openings, doorways, windows, 
and any other openings. If any debris, residue, dust or any other 
suspect material is detected, the final cleaning shall be repeated at 
no cost to the VA. Dust/material samples may be collected and analyzed 
at no cost to the VA at the discretion of the VPIH/CIH to confirm 
visual findings. When the regulated area is visually clean the final 
testing can be done. 

 

3.6.3 AIR CLEARANCE TESTING 

A. After an acceptable final visual inspection by the VPIH/CIH and VA 
Representative, a licensed air monitor will perform the final clearance 
testing. Air samples will be collected and analyzed in accordance with 
procedures for AHERA in this specification. If work is less than 260 
lf/160 sf/35 CF, 5 PCM samples shall be collected for clearance and a 
minimum of one field blank. If work is equal to or more than 260 lf/160 
sf/35 CF, AHERA TEM sampling shall be performed for clearance. TEM 
analysis shall be done in accordance with procedures for EPA AHERA in 
this specification. If the release criteria are not met, the Contractor 
shall repeat the final cleaning and continue decontamination procedures 
until clearance is achieved. All additional inspection and testing 
costs will be borne by the Contractor. 

B. If release criteria are met, proceed to perform the abatement closeout 
and to issue the certificate of completion in accordance with these 
specifications. 

 

3.6.4 FINAL AIR CLEARANCE PROCEDURES 

A. Contractor's Release Criteria: Work in a regulated area is complete 
when the regulated area is visually clean and airborne fiber levels 
have been reduced to or below 0.01 f/cc as measured by the AHERA PCM 
protocol, or 70 AHERA structures per square millimeter (s/mm2) by AHERA 
TEM. 


B. Air Monitoring and Final Clearance Sampling: To determine if the 
elevated airborne fiber counts encountered during abatement operations 
have been reduced to the specified level, the licensed air monitor will 
secure samples and analyze them according to the following procedures: 

1. Fibers Counted: “Fibers” referred to in this section shall be either 
all fibers regardless of composition as counted in the NIOSH 7400 
PCM method or asbestos fibers counted using the NIOSH 7400 PCM 
method. 



2. All clearance samples will be collected on 0.8. MCE filters for PCM 
analysis. A minimum of 1200 Liters of using calibrated pumps shall 
be collected for clearance samples. Before pumps are started, 
initiate aggressive air mixing sampling as detailed in 40 CFR 763 
Subpart E (AHERA) Appendix A (III)(B)(7)(d). Air samples will be 
collected in areas subject to normal air circulation away from 
corners, obstructed locations, and locations near windows, doors, or 
vents. After air sampling pumps have been shut off, circulating fans 
shall be shut off. The negative pressure system shall continue to 
operate. All results must be less than 0.01 f/cc for clearance.

place. Vibrate concrete to produce thorough compaction, complete 
embedment of reinforcement and concrete of uniform and maximum density 
without segregation of mix. Do not transport concrete in forms by 
vibration. 

1. Use of form vibration shall be approved only when concrete sections 
are too thin or too inaccessible for use of internal vibration. 

2. Carry on vibration continuously with placing of concrete. Do not 
insert vibrator into concrete that has begun to set. 

3.8 HOT WEATHER: 

 Follow the recommendations of ACI 305 or as specified to prevent 
problems in the manufacturing, placing, and curing of concrete that can 
adversely affect the properties and serviceability of the hardened 
concrete. Methods proposed for cooling materials and arrangements for 
protecting concrete shall be made in advance of concrete placement and 
approved by Resident Engineer. 

3.9 COLD WEATHER: 

 Follow the recommendations of ACI 306 or as specified to prevent 
freezing of concrete and to permit concrete to gain strength properly. 
Use only the specified non-corrosive, non-chloride accelerator. Do not 
use calcium chloride, thiocyantes or admixtures containing more than 
0.05 percent chloride ions. Methods proposed for heating materials and 
arrangements for protecting concrete shall be made in advance of 
concrete placement and approved by Resident Engineer. 


3.10 PROTECTION AND CURING: 

A. Conform to ACI 308: Initial curing shall immediately follow the 
finishing operation. Protect exposed surfaces of concrete from 
premature drying, wash by rain and running water, wind, mechanical 
injury, and excessively hot or cold temperatures. Keep concrete not 
covered with membrane or other curing material continuously wet for at 
least 7 days after placing, except wet curing period for high-earlystrength 
concrete shall be not less than 3 days. Keep wood forms 
continuously wet to prevent moisture loss until forms are removed. Cure 
exposed concrete surfaces as described below. Other curing methods may 
be used if approved by Resident Engineer. 

1. Liquid curing and sealing compounds: Apply by power-driven spray or 
roller in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Apply 
immediately after finishing. Maximum coverage 10m2/L (400 square feet 
per gallon) on steel troweled surfaces and 7.5m2/L (300 square feet 
per gallon) on floated or broomed surfaces for the curing/sealing 
compound. 

2. Plastic sheets: Apply as soon as concrete has hardened sufficiently 
to prevent surface damage. Utilize widest practical width sheet and 
overlap adjacent sheets 50 mm (2 inches). Tightly seal joints with 
tape. 

3. Paper: Utilize widest practical width paper and overlap adjacent 
sheets 50 mm (2 inches). Tightly seal joints with sand, wood planks, 
pressure-sensitive tape, mastic or glue. 

3.11 REMOVAL OF FORMS: 

A. Remove in a manner to assure complete safety of structure after the 
following conditions have been met. 

1. Where structure as a whole is supported on shores, forms for beams 
and girder sides, columns, and similar vertical structural members 
may be removed after 24 hours, provided concrete has hardened 
sufficiently to prevent surface damage and curing is continued 
without any lapse in time as specified for exposed surfaces. 

2. Take particular care in removing forms of architectural exposed 
concrete to insure surfaces are not marred or gouged, and that 
corners and arises are true, sharp and unbroken. 

B. Control Test: Use to determine if the concrete has attained sufficient 
strength and curing to permit removal of supporting forms. Cylinders 
required for control tests taken in accordance with ASTM C172, molded 


in accordance with ASTM C31, and tested in accordance with ASTM C39. 
Control cylinders cured and protected in the same manner as the 
structure they represent. Supporting forms or shoring not removed until 
strength of control test cylinders have attained at least 70 percent of 
minimum 28-day compressive strength specified. Exercise care to assure 
that newly unsupported portions of structure are not subjected to heavy 
construction or material loading. 

C. Reshoring: Reshoring is required if superimposed load plus dead load of 
the floor exceeds the capacity of the floor at the time of loading. 
Reshoring accomplished in accordance with ACI 347 at no additional cost 
to the Government. 

3.12 CONCRETE SURFACE PREPARATION: 

A. Metal Removal: Unnecessary metal items cut back flush with face of 
concrete members. 

B. Patching: Maintain curing and start patching as soon as forms are 
removed. Do not apply curing compounds to concrete surfaces requiring 
patching until patching is completed. Use cement mortar for patching of 
same composition as that used in concrete. Use white or gray Portland 
cement as necessary to obtain finish color matching surrounding 
concrete. Thoroughly clean areas to be patched. Cut out honeycombed or 
otherwise defective areas to solid concrete to a depth of not less than 
25 mm (1 inch). Cut edge perpendicular to surface of concrete. Saturate 
with water area to be patched, and at least 150 mm (6 inches) 
surrounding before placing patching mortar. Give area to be patched a 
brush coat of cement grout followed immediately by patching mortar. 
Cement grout composed of one part Portland cement, 1.5 parts fine sand, 
bonding admixture, and water at a 50:50 ratio, mix to achieve 
consistency of thick paint. Mix patching mortar approximately 1 hour 
before placing and remix occasionally during this period without 
addition of water. Compact mortar into place and screed slightly higher 
than surrounding surface. After initial shrinkage has occurred, finish 
to match color and texture of adjoining surfaces. Cure patches as 
specified for other concrete. Fill form tie holes which extend entirely 
through walls from unexposed face by means of a pressure gun or other 
suitable device to force mortar through wall. Wipe excess mortar off 
exposed face with a cloth. 

C. Upon removal of forms, clean vertical concrete surface that is to 
receive bonded applied cementitious application with wire brushes or by 


sand blasting to remove unset material, laitance, and loose particles 
to expose aggregates to provide a clean, firm, granular surface for 
bond of applied finish. 

3.13 CONCRETE FINISHES: 

A. Vertical and Overhead Surface Finishes: 

1. Unfinished areas: Vertical and overhead concrete surfaces exposed in 
pipe basements, elevator and dumbwaiter shafts, pipe spaces, pipe 
trenches, above suspended ceilings, manholes, and other unfinished 
areas will not require additional finishing. 

2. Interior and exterior exposed areas to be painted: Remove fins, 
burrs and similar projections on surfaces flush, and smooth by 
mechanical means approved by Resident Engineer, and by rubbing 
lightly with a fine abrasive stone or hone. Use ample water during 
rubbing without working up a lather of mortar or changing texture of 
concrete. 

3. Interior and exterior exposed areas finished: Give a grout finish of 
uniform color and smooth finish treated as follows: 

a. After concrete has hardened and laitance, fins and burrs removed, 
scrub concrete with wire brushes. Clean stained concrete surfaces 
by use of a hone stone. 

b. Apply grout composed of one part of Portland cement, one part 
fine sand, smaller than a 600 µm (No. 30) sieve. Work grout into 
surface of concrete with cork floats or fiber brushes until all 
pits, and honeycombs are filled. 

c. After grout has hardened slightly, but while still plastic, 
scrape grout off with a sponge rubber float and, about 1 hour 
later, rub concrete vigorously with burlap to remove any excess 
grout remaining on surfaces. 

d. In hot, dry weather use a fog spray to keep grout wet during 
setting period. Complete finish of area in same day. Make limits 
of finished areas at natural breaks in wall surface. Leave no 
grout on concrete surface overnight. 

4. Textured: Finish as specified. Maximum quantity of patched area 0.2 
m2 (2 square feet) in each 93 m2 (1000 square feet) of textured 
surface. 

B. Slab Finishes: 

1. Monitoring and Adjustment: Provide continuous cycle of placement, 
measurement, evaluation and adjustment of procedures to produce 


slabs within specified tolerances. Monitor elevations of structural 
steel in key locations before and after concrete placement to 
establish typical deflection patterns for the structural steel. 
Determine elevations of cast-in-place slab soffits prior to removal 
of shores. Provide information to Resident Engineer and floor 
consultant for evaluation and recommendations for subsequent 
placements. 

2. Set perimeter forms to serve as screed using either optical or laser 
instruments. For slabs on grade, wet screeds may be used to 
establish initial grade during strike-off, unless Resident Engineer 
determines that the method is proving insufficient to meet required 
finish tolerances and directs use of rigid screed guides. Where wet 
screeds are allowed, they shall be placed using grade stakes set by 
optical or laser instruments. Use rigid screed guides, as opposed to 
wet screeds, to control strike-off elevation for all types of 
elevated (non slab-on-grade) slabs. Divide bays into halves or 
thirds by hard screeds. Adjust as necessary where monitoring of 
previous placements indicates unshored structural steel deflections 
to other than a level profile. 

3. Place slabs monolithically. Once slab placement commences, complete 
finishing operations within same day. Slope finished slab to floor 
drains where they occur, whether shown or not. 

4. Use straightedges specifically made for screeding, such as hollow 
magnesium straightedges or power strike-offs. Do not use pieces of 
dimensioned lumber. Strike off and screed slab to a true surface at 
required elevations. Use optical or laser instruments to check 
concrete finished surface grade after strike-off. Repeat strike-off 
as necessary. Complete screeding before any excess moisture or 
bleeding water is present on surface. Do not sprinkle dry cement on 
the surface. 

5. Immediately following screeding, and before any bleed water appears, 
use a 3000 mm (10 foot) wide highway straightedge in a cutting and 
filling operation to achieve surface flatness. Do not use bull 
floats or darbys, except that darbying may be allowed for narrow 
slabs and restricted spaces. 

6. Wait until water sheen disappears and surface stiffens before 
proceeding further. Do not perform subsequent operations until 


concrete will sustain foot pressure with maximum of 6 mm (1/4 inch) 
indentation. 

7. Scratch Finish: Finish base slab to receive a bonded applied 
cementitious application as indicated above, except that bull floats 
and darbys may be used. Thoroughly coarse wire broom within two 
hours after placing to roughen slab surface to insure a permanent 
bond between base slab and applied materials. 

8. Float Finish: Slabs to receive unbonded toppings, steel trowel 
finish, fill, mortar setting beds, or a built-up roof, and ramps, 
stair treads, platforms (interior and exterior), and equipment pads 
shall be floated to a smooth, dense uniform, sandy textured finish. 
During floating, while surface is still soft, check surface for 
flatness using a 3000 mm (10 foot) highway straightedge. Correct 
high spots by cutting down and correct low spots by filling in with 
material of same composition as floor finish. Remove any surface 
projections and re-float to a uniform texture. 

9. Steel Trowel Finish: Concrete surfaces to receive resilient floor 
covering or carpet, monolithic floor slabs to be exposed to view in 
finished work, future floor roof slabs, applied toppings, and other 
interior surfaces for which no other finish is indicated. Steel 
trowel immediately following floating. During final troweling, tilt 
steel trowel at a slight angle and exert heavy pressure to compact 
cement paste and form a dense, smooth surface. Finished surface 
shall be smooth, free of trowel marks, and uniform in texture and 
appearance. 

10. Broom Finish: Finish exterior slabs, ramps, and stair treads with a 
bristle brush moistened with clear water after surfaces have been 
floated. Brush in a direction transverse to main traffic. Match 
texture approved by Resident Engineer from sample panel. 

11. Finished slab flatness (FF) and levelness (FL) values comply with 
the following minimum requirements: 

a. Areas covered with carpeting, or not specified otherwise in b. 
below: 

1) Slab on Grade: 

a) Specified overall value FF 25/FL 20 

b) Minimum local value FF 17/FL 15 

2) Level suspended slabs (shored until after testing) and topping 
slabs: 


a) Specified overall value FF 25/FL 20 

b) Minimum local value FF 17/FL 15 

3) Unshored suspended slabs: 

a) Specified overall value FF 25 

b) Minimum local value FF 17 

4) Level tolerance such that 80 percent of all points fall within 
a 20 mm (3/4 inch) envelope +10 mm, -10 mm (+3/8 inch, -3/8 
inch) from the design elevation. 

b. Areas that will be exposed, receive thin-set tile or resilient 
flooring, or roof areas designed as future floors: 

1) Slab on grade: 

a) Specified overall value FF 36/FL 20 

b) Minimum local value FF 24/FL 15 

2) Level suspended slabs (shored until after testing) and topping 
slabs 

a) Specified overall value FF 30/FL 20 

b) Minimum local value FF 24/FL 15 

3) Unshored suspended slabs: 

a) Specified overall value FF 30 

b) Minimum local value FF 24 

4) Level tolerance such that 80 percent of all points fall within 
a 20 mm (3/4 inch) envelope +10 mm, -10 mm (+3/8 inch, -3/8 
inch) from the design elevation. 

c. "Specified overall value" is based on the composite of all 
measured values in a placement derived in accordance with ASTM 
E1155. 

d. "Minimum local value" (MLV) describes the flatness or levelness 
below which repair or replacement is required. MLV is based on 
the results of an individual placement and applies to a minimum 
local area. Minimum local area boundaries may not cross a 
construction joint or expansion joint. A minimum local area will 
be bounded by construction and/or control joints, or by column 
lines and/or half-column lines, whichever is smaller. 

12. Measurements 

a. Department of Veterans Affairs retained testing laboratory will 
take measurements as directed by Resident Engineer, to verify 
compliance with FF, FL, and other finish requirements. 
Measurements will occur within 72 hours after completion of 


concrete placement (weekends and holidays excluded). Make 
measurements before shores or forms are removed to insure the 
"as-built" levelness is accurately assessed. Profile data for 
above characteristics may be collected using a laser level or any 
Type II apparatus (ASTM E1155, "profileograph" or "dipstick"). 
Contractor's surveyor shall establish reference elevations to be 
used by Department of Veterans Affairs retained testing 
laboratory. 

b. Contractor not experienced in using FF and FL criteria is 
encouraged to retain the services of a floor consultant to assist 
with recommendations concerning adjustments to slab thicknesses, 
finishing techniques, and procedures on measurements of the 
finish as it progresses in order to achieve the specific flatness 
and levelness numbers. 

13. Acceptance/ Rejection: 

a. If individual slab section measures less than either of specified 
minimum local FF/FL numbers, that section shall be rejected and 
remedial measures shall be required. Sectional boundaries may be 
set at construction and contraction (control) joints, and not 
smaller than one-half bay. 

b. If composite value of entire slab installation, combination of 
all local results, measures less than either of specified overall 
FF/FL numbers, then whole slab shall be rejected and remedial 
measures shall be required. 

14. Remedial Measures for Rejected Slabs: Correct rejected slab areas by 
grinding, planing, surface repair with underlayment compound or 
repair topping, retopping, or removal and replacement of entire 
rejected slab areas, as directed by Resident Engineer, until a slab 
finish constructed within specified tolerances is accepted. 

3.14 SURFACE TREATMENTS: 

A. Use on exposed concrete floors and concrete floors to receive 
carpeting. 

B. Liquid Densifier/Sealer: Apply in accordance with manufacturer's 
directions just prior to completion of construction. 

C. Non-Slip Finish: Except where safety nosing and tread coverings are 
shown, apply non-slip abrasive aggregate to treads and platforms of 
concrete steps and stairs, and to surfaces of exterior concrete ramps 
and platforms. Broadcast aggregate uniformly over concrete surface at 


rate of application of 8% per 1/10th m2 (7.5 percent per square foot) of 
area. Trowel concrete surface to smooth dense finish. After curing, rub 
treated surface with abrasive brick and water to slightly expose 
abrasive aggregate. 

3.15 APPLIED TOPPING: 

A. Separate concrete topping on floor base slab of thickness and strength 
shown. Topping mix shall have a maximum slump of 200 mm (8 inches) for 
concrete containing a high-range water-reducing admixture 
(superplasticizer) and 100 mm (4 inches) for conventional mix. Neatly 
bevel or slope at door openings and at slabs adjoining spaces not 
receiving an applied finish. 

B. Placing: Place continuously until entire section is complete, struck 
off with straightedge, leveled with a highway straightedge or highway 
bull float, floated and troweled by machine to a hard dense finish. 
Slope to floor drains as required. Do not start floating until free 
water has disappeared and no water sheen is visible. Allow drying of 
surface moisture naturally. Do not hasten by "dusting" with cement or 
sand. 

3.16 RESURFACING FLOORS: 

 Remove existing flooring areas to receive resurfacing to expose 
existing structural slab and extend not less than 25 mm (1 inch) below 
new finished floor level. Prepare exposed structural slab surface by 
roughening, broom cleaning, and dampening. Apply specified bonding 
grout. Place topping while the bonding grout is still tacky. 

 

3.17 RETAINING WALLS: 

A. Use air-entrained concrete. 

B. Expansion and contraction joints, waterstops, weep holes, reinforcement 
and railing sleeves installed and constructed as shown. 

C. Exposed surfaces finished to match adjacent concrete surfaces, new or 
existing.

tank maximum pressure, plus pump head. Factory tested equipment 
(convertors, exchangers, coils, etc.) need not be field tested. Isolate 
equipment where necessary to avoid excessive pressure on mechanical 
seals and safety devices. 

3.6 FLUSHING AND CLEANING PIPING SYSTEMS 

A. Water Piping: Clean systems as recommended by pipe manufacturer. 

1. Initial flushing: Remove loose dirt, mill scale, metal chips, weld 
beads, rust, and like deleterious substances without damage to any 
system component. Provide temporary piping or hose to bypass coils, 
control valves, exchangers and other factory cleaned equipment 
unless acceptable means of protection are provided and subsequent 
inspection of hide-out areas takes place. Isolate or protect clean 
system components, including pumps and pressure vessels, and remove 
any component which may be damaged. Open all valves, drains, vents 
and strainers at all system levels. Remove plugs, caps, spool 
pieces, and components to facilitate early debris discharge from 
system. Sectionalize system to obtain debris carrying velocity of 
1.8 m/S (6 feet per second), if possible. Connect dead-end supply 
and return headers as necessary. Flush bottoms of risers. Install 
temporary strainers where necessary to protect down-stream 
equipment. Supply and remove flushing water and drainage by various 
type hose, temporary and permanent piping and Contractor's booster 
pumps. Flush until clean as approved by the Resident Engineer. 

2. Cleaning: Using products approved by pipe manufacturer, circulate 
systems at normal temperature to remove adherent organic soil, 
hydrocarbons, flux, pipe mill varnish, pipe joint compounds, iron 
oxide, and like deleterious substances not removed by flushing, 
without chemical or mechanical damage to any system component. 
Removal of tightly adherent mill scale is not required. Keep 
isolated equipment which is "clean" and where dead-end debris 
accumulation cannot occur. Sectionalize system if possible, to 
circulate at velocities not less than 1.8 m/S (6 feet per second). 
Circulate each section for not less than four hours. Blow-down all 
strainers, or remove and clean as frequently as necessary. Drain and 
prepare for final flushing. 


3. Final Flushing: Return systems to conditions required by initial 
flushing after all cleaning solution has been displaced by clean 
make-up. Flush all dead ends and isolated clean equipment. Gently 
operate all valves to dislodge any debris in valve body by 
throttling velocity. Flush for not less than one hour.

3. VA Medical Center, CBOC/OPC Locations 

Wiring Closet and Cabling Run 

Specifications for Remote Locations 

 

General Requirements: 

 


All telecommunications cabling and telecommunications physical space 
must conform to established industry standards (NEC, NFPA, OSHA, IEEE, 
EIA/TIA, etc.) including the following practices: 

. ONLY telecommunications equipment may be located in wiring 
closets. Electrical service panels, HVAC equipment, natural gas 
or water control valves, etc. must be located elsewhere. 
. Length of any UTP cable run from patch panel in wiring closet to 
RJ-45 data jack at wall plate must not exceed 90 meters. If 
contractor cannot meet this requirement with a centrally located 
wiring closet, contractor must provide additional wiring closets 
conforming to the specifications outlined in this document. 


 

 Environmental/Electrical: 

 

A telephone/data wiring closet must be provided, with dimensions of at 
least 10’ x 10’ in size. The floor must be sealed concrete or low 
static tile. It must have lighting controlled by a wall switch 
directly inside the closet by the entry. Lighting fixtures shall be 
flush-mounted, and shall ensure a lighting level of 100 foot-candles 
on working surfaces with a near (natural) light color rendition. 
Heating and cooling shall be provided in the closet to ensure 
68degrees F. 20-amp duplex or quad electrical receptacles must be 
located on each wall and each receptacle must be connected to one or 
more circuits that are isolated from receptacles outside the closet. 
The door must open outward to avoid collisions with network equipment 
or, if inward opening, provide at least five feet of clearance between 
the door and any network equipment. 

 

Equipment Mounting Hardware: 

 

At the center of the room (Intermediate Distribution Room) opposite 
from the entry, a contractor-provided 7-foot X 19-inch, T-style twopost 
equipment rack supporting 19” rack-mount equipment (Chatsworth 
Standard Rack, Part Number 55053-503) must be installed. ). Contractor 
must also provide horizontal cable management (Chatsworth Universal 
horizontal Cable Manager, Part Number 30130-719, quantity of two) 
centered over rack mount and mounted to left and right walls. Vertical 
cable management must be provided by contractor and attached to each 
side of the rack (Chatsworth CCS Combination Cabling Section, Part 
Number 30162-703). The rack must be bolted to the floor for stability 
and oriented for easy access from front and back (ideally this would 
be at least 4-foot clearance, front and back). It must also be 
connected by grounding strip to the building ground. VA OI&T staff 
will be responsible for the purchase and installation of network 
electronics and uninterruptible power supplies. 

 

Adjacent to the T-style equipment rack, one or more walls must be 
covered with ¾-inch fireproof plywood. A remote telephone switch 
requiring wall mounting will be provided and installed in this area by 
VA OI&T staff. Ideally, this should be the same or adjacent wall to 


where Local Exchange Carrier point-of-presence equipment is or will be 
installed. 

 

UTP Telecommunications Cabling: 

 

Sufficient patch panels must be provided to match the number of UTP 
data/VOIP cable home runs from the new wiring closet to individual 
room locations, plus 10-15% for growth. These patch panels must be 
mounted with top panel starting at approximately 5.5 foot height of 
the contractor-provided 7-foot X 19-inch, T-style equipment rack. The 
patch panels must be 48-port Systimax PATCHMAX PowerSUM RJ-45 Modular 
to IDC 568-B (manufacturer part number 108 320 045, also known as 
PM2150PSE-48) in order to match our VA OI&T standard infrastructure. 
All UTP DATA/VOIP cable home runs must be terminated in the wiring 
closet in patch panels using the 568-B standard. 

 

 All UTP analog/digital voice home runs must be terminated in 
contractor-provided, wall-mounted 110-block IDF in close proximity to 
location for VA OI&T-provided telephone switch and allow for easy 
cross-connect. The provision of both DATA/VOIP cable runs and 
analog/digital voice cable runs provides flexibility for the location 
to support a mixture of PBX, VOIP and POTS voice services over time. 

 

Belden, Berk-Tek or comparable Cat 5e (or greater) cabling should be 
used for all UTP cabling home runs (voice and data). Once terminated, 
UTP cabling must be capable of supporting 10/100/1000-BASE-TX Ethernet 
traffic. All UTP cabling home runs must be terminated by 568-B modular 
RJ-45 jacks in flush-mount wall plates. The standard network drop 
consists of two phone and two data jacks with one pink, one blue and 
one green cat 5E or better cable. A typical room requires two standard 
network drops. For ease of tracing, troubleshooting or relocation, 
cable jacket colors must be white for the voice jack, blue for the 
first data jack, green for the 2nd jack, with corresponding color 
jacks in wall plate. Use of Red and yellow jack denotes special 
purpose applications (VoIP, bio-med, emergency phone). 

 

Individual cable pulls shall not exceed 250 linear feet to meet 
compliance with set 568-B standards. 

 

Labeling of Cabling Runs: 

In order to match our VA OI&T standard infrastructure, the required 
components are as follows: 

 

Wall Plate: Hubbell 1FP14OW (fits single-gang box) 

White Jack: Hubbell HXJ5EOW 

Green Jack: Hubbell HXJ5EB 

Blue Jack: Hubbell HXJ5EGN 

 

A label at the top of the wall plate must list the IDF closet location 
by room number, as in IDF-170 in Illustration 1 below. Room numbers 
will be assigned by VA staff in advance of any cabling pulls. A label 
below each jack must indicate the room number and sequential jack 


position. Analog/digital phone jacks are labeled numerically and 
data/VOIP jacks are labeled alphabetically. As an example, upon 
entering a room, the first quad receptacle would be labeled room #- 
seq. #, such as 101-1 for the voice jack and 101-A, 101-B and 101-C 
for the VOIP and data jacks. Continue around the room in clockwise 
order incrementing the sequence until all wall jacks are labeled. See 
photo below as example. 

Wall Jack 


Illustration 1: Sample wall plate with all required 
labeling 

 

 

Contractor must clearly label all patch panel jacks, 110-panel 
positions and cross-connects to match the labeling of the wall plate 
jacks. 

 

 

Testing of Completed Cabling: 

Once UTP data cabling has been pulled and terminated at both ends, the 
contractor must test each cable ran to confirm that it is capable of 
supporting data transmission rates indicated above and conforms to 
cabling standards listed above. The contractor must supply a report 
documenting the test results. The report should be submitted in 
electronic format. The expected end results in all CAVHS communication 
projects IS a ZERO (0) % FAILURE RATE DURING THE TESTING PHASE.

D. Acceptance Test Procedure: 

1. Physical and Mechanical Inspection: 

a. The TVE 005OP3B Representative will tour all major areas where 
the Nurse Call and/or Code Blue System and all sub-systems are 
completely and properly installed to insure they are 
operationally ready for proof of performance testing. A system 
inventory including available spare parts will be taken at this 


time. Each item of installed equipment shall be checked to ensure 
appropriate UL certification labels are affixed. 

b. The System diagrams, record drawings, equipment manuals, TIP Auto 
CAD Disks, intermediate, and pretest results shall be formally 
inventoried and reviewed. 

c. Failure of the System to meet the installation requirements of 
this specification shall be grounds for terminating all testing. 

2. Operational Test: 

a. After the Physical and Mechanical Inspection, the central 
terminating and nurse call master control equipment shall be 
checked to verify that it meets all performance requirements 
outlined herein. A spectrum analyzer and sound level meter may be 
utilized to accomplish this requirement. 

b. Following the central equipment test, a pillow speaker (or on 
board speaker) shall be connected to the central terminating and 
nurse call master control equipment’s output tap to ensure there 
are no signal distortions such as intermodulation, data noise, 
popping sounds, erratic system functions, on any function. 

c. The distribution system shall be checked at each interface, 
junction, and distribution point, first, middle, and last 
intersectional, room, and bed dome light in each leg to verify 
that the nurse call distribution system meets all system 
performance standards. 

d. Each MATV outlet that is controlled by a nurse call pillow 
speaker shall be functionally tested at the same time utilizing 
the Contractor’s approved hospital grade HDTV receiver and TV 
remote control cable. 

e. The RED system and volume stepper switches shall be checked to 
insure proper operation of the pillow speaker, the volume stepper 
and the RED system (if installed). 

f. Additionally, each installed emergency, patient, staff, duty, 
panic station, intersectional, room, and bed dome light, power 
supply, code one, and remote annunciator panels shall be checked 
insuring they meet the requirements of this specification. 

g. Once these tests have been completed, each installed sub-system 
function shall be tested as a unified, functioning and fully 
operating system. The typical functions are: nurse follower, 
three levels of emergency signaling (i.e. flashing red emergency, 


flashing white patient emergency, flashing white or combination 
lights for staff emergency, separate flashing code blue), minimum 
of 10 minutes of UPS operation, memory saving, minimum of ten 
station audio paging, canceling emergency calls at each 
originating station only, and storage and prioritizing of calls. 

h. Individual Item Test: The TVE 005OP3B Representative will select 
individual items of equipment for detailed proof of performance 
testing until 100% of the System has been tested and found to 
meet the contents of this specification. Each item shall meet or 
exceed the minimum requirements of this document. 

3. Test Conclusion: 

a. At the conclusion of the Acceptance Test, using the generated 
punch list (or discrepancy list) the VA and the Contractor shall 
jointly agree to the results of the test, and reschedule testing 
on deficiencies and shortages with the RE. Any retesting to 
comply with these specifications will be done at the Contractor's 
expense. 

b. If the System is declared unacceptable without conditions, all 
rescheduled testing expenses will be borne by the Contractor. 

E. Acceptable Test Equipment: The test equipment shall furnished by the 
Contractor shall have a calibration tag of an acceptable calibration 
service dated not more than 12 months prior to the test. As part of the 
submittal, a test equipment list shall be furnished that includes the 
make and model number of the following type of equipment as a minimum: 

1. Spectrum Analyzer. 

2. Signal Level Meter.

upgrades, as further defined below. 
(e) Technical Support. The term “technical support” refers to the 
range of services providing assistance for the software via the 
telephone, email, a website or otherwise. 
(f) Release or Update. The term “release” or “update” are terms that 
refer to a revision of software that contains defect corrections, 
minor enhancements or improvements of the software’s 
functionality. This is usually designated by a change in the 
number to the right of the decimal point (e.g., from Version 5.3 
to 5.4). An example of an update is the addition of new 
hardware. 
(g) Version or Upgrade. The term “version” or “upgrade” are terms 
that refer to a revision of software that contains new or 
improved functionality. This is usually designated by a change 
in the number to the left of the decimal point (e.g., from 
Version 5.4 to 6). 


 

(2) License. Grant of License and Term. 

 

(a) See also Addendum B. 
(b) Unless otherwise stated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, the 
software license provided to the Government is a perpetual, 
nonexclusive license to use the software. 
(c) The license authorizes the Government to use the software in 
processing data for other federal agencies. 
(d) If the licensed software requires a password (or license key) to 
be operational, it shall be delivered with the software media and 
have no expiration date. 
(e) If the Government decides to outsource or contract its services, 
the Government may allow the outsourcer to use the licensed 
software solely to provide the services on its behalf. The 
outsourcer shall be bound by the provisions of this Contract 
relating to the use of the software. 



(f) If the software is for use in a networked environment, as may be 
reflected by the number of servers or users described in the 
Contract/Order, the license grant provided by the Contractor 
includes the Government’s use of the software in such 
environment. 
(g) Any dispute regarding the license grant or usage limitations 
shall be resolved in accordance with the Disputes Clause 
incorporated in FAR 52.212-4(d). 
(h) If the Government purchases additional licenses, the terms and 
conditions for those additional licenses (including technical 
support and upgrade subscription) shall be the same as agreed to 
in this Contract/Order, unless negotiated otherwise by mutual 
agreement of the parties. 
(i) The licensed software contains critical product functionality 
that meets the minimum needs of the Government and is the basis 
for the Government’s procurement of the software; consequently, 
the Contractor agrees that the Government has the right to 
successor products at no additional cost when functionality is 
later unbundled from the product licensed herein and bundled into 
a new or different product, provided the Government is current on 
maintenance. 
(j) If the Contractor is a reseller for the computer software being 
acquired under this Contract/Order, it is permissible for the 
actual software manufacturer (Licensor) to deliver the software 
directly to the Government. 
(k) All limitations of software usage are expressly stated in the SF 
1449 and Addendum A and Addendum B. 


 

(3) Software Maintenance Subscription and Technical Support. 


 

(a) See also Addendum B. 
(b) Software maintenance and technical support are included at the 
agreed upon price. However, if additional charges are assessed 
during the maintenance and technical support period as a result 
of negotiated changes in the license (e.g., CPU upgrades), the 
fee shall be by mutual agreement of the parties and any dispute 
thereof shall be resolved in accordance with the Disputes Clause 
incorporated herein at FAR 52.212-4(g). 
(c) If the Government desires to continue software maintenance and 
support beyond the period identified in this Contract/Order, the 
Government will issue a separate contract or order to renew 
annual maintenance and technical support. Conversely, if an 
order or contract to renew software maintenance and technical 
support is not received, no assumption by the Contractor shall be 
made that it has been renewed. It shall not be automatically 
renewed. 
(d) Unless otherwise agreed, for any new additional software that may 
be licensed, the Contractor shall provide for software 
maintenance and technical support for the first year of the 
license at no additional cost. 
(e) Unless otherwise agreed, the Contractor shall provide VA with 
software maintenance, which includes periodic updates, upgrades, 
enhancements and corrections to the software, and reasonable 
technical support, all of which are customarily provided by the 
Contractor to its customers so as to cause the software to 
perform according to its specifications, documentation or 
demonstrated claims. 



(f) Any telephone support provided by Contractor shall be at no 
additional cost. 
(g) All technical support services will be provided in a timely 
manner in accordance with the Contractor’s customary practice. 
However, prolonged delay in resolving software problems will be 
noted in the Government’s various past performance records on the 
Contractor (e.g., www.ppirs.gov). 
(h) If the Government allows the maintenance and/or technical support 
to lapse and subsequently wishes to reinstate maintenance and 
technical support, any reinstatement fee charged shall not exceed 
the amounts that would have been charged if the Government had 
not allowed it to lapse. 


 

A.12 Disabling Software Code. The Government requires delivery of computer 
software that does not contain any code that will, upon the occurrence or the 
nonoccurrence of any event, disable the software. Such code includes but is 
not limited to a computer virus, restrictive key, node lock, time-out or 
other function, whether implemented by electronic, mechanical, or other 
means, which limits or hinders the use or access to any computer software 
based on residency on a specific hardware configuration, frequency of 
duration of use, or other limiting criteria. If any such code is present, 
the Contractor agrees to indemnify the Government for all damages suffered as 
a result of a disabling caused by such code, and the Contractor agrees to 
remove such code upon the Government’s request at no extra cost to the 
Government. Inability of the Contractor to remove the disabling software 
code will be considered an inexcusable delay and a material breach of 
contract, and the Government may exercise its right to terminate for cause. 
In addition, the Government is permitted to remove the code as it deems 
appropriate and charge the Contractor for consideration for the time and 
effort in removing the code. 

 

A.13 Disaster Recovery Clause. Government hereby certifies to Contractor 
that it has a bona fide disaster plan with respect to the computer software 
programs used in its operations. The Contract/Order authorizes the 
Government's operation to maintain a second copy of software on tape for use 
at loading at sites that are not live (e.g. subscription-based disaster 
recovery services) for the sole purpose of duplicating or mirroring the 
software environment of the "primary" licenses at the designated licensed 
site and as described herein. Additionally, use of the software at the 
contingency sites must not include general access or any processing for 
program development or production. Contractor shall permit operation and 
testing of all licensed programs at the contingency sites as designated by 
the Government without prior approval and at no additional cost to the 
Government solely for the purpose of maintaining or implementing disaster 
recovery readiness including continuity of business operations. CPU’s, MIPS 
or MSU’s at these contingency sites are excluded from the total CPU’s, MIPS 
or MSU’s count included elsewhere in the Contract/Order and are not 
separately billable. Activation of operations at a contingency site shall be 
at Government's discretion. Government is authorized to install all software 
at the contingency sites for testing, problem resolution purposes, and to 
ensure there will be no operational delays in association with transition of 
workload from the designated licensed site to the contingency sites. Use of 
the software at the contingency sites in the event of a disaster shall 
continue until such time as normal processing can be resumed at the "primary" 
site regardless of the duration required. Nothing in the Contract/Order 
diminishes the Government's rights in accordance with the data rights 
clause(s). Any license keys, codes, or passwords required by the Contractor 


in order to use the software at the contingency sites shall be provided to 
the Government within 10 days of the Government’s request. 

 

A.14 NOTICE OF THE FEDERAL ACCESSIBILITY LAW AFFECTING ALL ELECTRONIC AND 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROCUREMENTS (SECTION 508)

1. We have received the subject VACO MOU (signed copy attached), and 
are pleased to provide the following information and comments for your 
review that includes our risks and risk-mitigation factors that 
prompted our Facility’s decision: 

a. RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION: 

(1) Background: 

(a) (name) VAMC (here-in-after referred to as “the 
Facility”) has used (OEM Mdl Nr©) for over 10 years to allow nurses 
in the telemetry studio to communicate with nurses at the patients’ 
bedside. This communication medium is a vital patient safety tool 
that allows for rapid response to the development of a potentially 
fatal arrhythmia such as ventricular tachycardia. The only 
information the telemetry technician states on the phone is “bed 109-2 
Smith has an alarm for XXXXX.” Last four is never communicated. In 
terms of the pager we have limited the information on the pager to 
sector, bed number and last name. We must include the last name as 
occasionally the patients are moved without the knowledge of the 
telemetry technician, if we were to have a patient mix up the page 
must contain the last name for safety reasons. Facility Management 
Services (FMS) has restricted paging access to the telemetry system 
only. Because pager access is restricted, only an administrator from 
Technology and Information Management (TIM) or FMS can troubleshoot a 
pager malfunction. 

VAMC (City), (State – ZIP Code), Unregulated FCC Equipment Use, Risk 
Assessment and Mitigation, Page Two 


(b) Because the phones are used 24X7 and have exceeded 
their life expectancy, many of them have begun to fail which creates a 
need to purchase newer models that will continue to insure system 
integrity. 

(c) Our Facility has been prevented from purchasing 
replacement phones because VACO now has updated security and 
Information Technology (IT) connection controls along with continuing 
FCC Part 15 restrictions (described in the attached MOU) on devices of 
which these wireless phones are but one example. These updated 
security and connection controls are in place to address risks related 
life safety, information security, personal privacy and IT system 
integrity. The FCC restrictions continue to warn against the use of 
“non-regulated radio / wireless based equipment in safety of life 
locations and functions.” Of note, these controls are intended to 
prevent use of these devices in areas especially where a code-blue 
annunciation might occur, yet our devices have been used in such areas 
for over 10 years and so far has not prevented a code-blue 
annunciation from happening. 

(d) Because the Facility does not have a near-term 
alternative to the current wireless phones, it now faces a set of 
competing risks. On the one hand are the risks of privacy, connection 
and interference or security breach(s) that are behind the controls in 
place for these devices. On the other hand are risks to patient 
safety if the current phones were to fail and telemetry nurses would 
lose the ability to rapidly communicate with nurses at the bedside. 
Our Facility does have a Life Safety approved Nurses Call / Code Blue 
hardwired system that is installed in those affected areas as the 
primary Code Blue Enunciation media. 

(2) SECURITY: 

(a) NEC provides a proprietary scrambling algorithm that 
is applied to handset registration / authentication and all 
communications. Every time a (OEM Mdl Nr©) user enters a designated 
area within the systems’ coverage; an automatic user authentication 
process is performed to confirm the device is authorized for service 
on the system. This information is scrambled using a proprietary 
coding scheme to prevent duplication. All voice conversations are 
also scrambled to enhance security. 

(b) The (OEM Mdl Nr©) has several built in security features 
in each of the wireless handsets are administered through the 
Facility’s Telephone Private Branch Exchange (PBX) administration 
tool; therefore, the PBX Administrator has full control over the (OEM 
Mdl Nr©) wireless phones, if one gets lost or stolen it can be 
disabled immediately. Because of this feature you cannot purchase a 
similar wireless phone and have it work on our network. These phones 
have a 50 ft radius from the Zone radio frequency (RF) transceiver; 
they can only be used within the hospital as there is no handoff via 
other cellular networks. 

(c) These items are not NIST FIPS compliant; but based on 
the aforementioned facts, we feel patient / staff privacy and HIPAA 
instructions have been and will continue to be met. 


(d) Our Facility will work with (OEM) and VACO’s Office of 
Cyber Security (Name and Phone Nr) to secure the appropriate NIST FIPS 
certifications will allow VA to issue a Official Approvals from the 
onset in the IT equipment / system procurement process.

Assessment and Mitigation, Page Three 

(3) RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) INTERFERENCE: 

(a) (OEM) engineers provided us with extensive 
information on the potential for RF along with electromagnetic (EM) 
interference to medical equipment within our Facility from the (OEM 
System) Wireless radio transceivers. 

1) Field Experience: Since introduction of the (OEM 
System) Wireless product in 1996, NEC has installed this system at 
many health care institutions across the spectrum of medical 
departments. In all this time there have been zero reports of either 
suspected or actual RF and EM interference. This includes the 
experience using these devices at Portland VAMC and our continued 
testing documentation is available for review if requested. 

2) Potential interference called Near Field Coupling: In 
these cases, an EM field emanating from one device may cause another 
device within its field area to malfunction. Typically the distances 
for these fields are less than six (6) inches. In attempts to 
mitigate these sources of interference, standards have been put in 
place, namely IEC 60601. This standard calls for devices susceptible 
to interference to provide shielding against fields of up to three (3) 
Volts per Meter. In contrast, the (OEM System) wireless products are 
classified under the FCC Part 15 rules as Class B unlicensed devices, 
and as such must meet very tight restrictions regarding field 
emissions of a maximum of from 100 to 500 micro (µ) Volts per Meter 
across the band of RFs from 30 Hz to 18 gHz. Thus, any medical device 
even marginally meeting the IEC Standard has not had problems with any 
near field emissions. 

3) Potential phenomenon known as Far Field Induced RFI: 
should be considered when studying RF and EM interference sources. In 
this case, a part of the device subject to interference (e.g., a wire, 
probe, or the casing itself) can inadvertently act as a receiving 
antenna for a signal transmitted from another device within close 
proximity (within 6 to 18 inches, depending on the source power 
levels). To realize this type of interference, the source transmitter 
power must be fairly strong to conduct through the inefficient nature 
of the unintended antenna of the receiving device, and the material 
acting as the antenna must be of a shape and length that matches or is 
a near multiple of the wavelength of the transmitted RF signal. 
Finally, this unintentional antenna must not have the typical 
shielding between it and the subject device’s electronics, which if 
present would prevent such a received signal from causing 
interference. In the case of the (OEM System) Wireless transmission, 
which operates between 1,920 mHz and 1,930 mHz, a probe or such piece 
of any medical device measuring at about six (6) inches would match 
the wavelength of the RF carrier, and if not properly shielded from 


the units electronics may indeed conduct the RF energy within. 
However, even in this case, one must consider the power level at the 
so-called antenna receiving the signal. The average output of the 
(OEM Mdl Nr©) handset is approximately 10 mili (m) Watts when in use. 
This very low power, even further reduced by the distance between any 
handset in use and the subject receiving equipment, considered along 
with the high loss of the “antenna”, results in a very low probability 
of actual interference. These facts, along with the standard 
procedures of your engineering department’s efforts to check the 
medical equipment for such shielding and filtering defects, should 
mitigate this potential source. 

4) Potential interference between intentional radiators 
operating in the RF band. Known as either in-band or out-of-band 
interference, these are cases where a transmitter broadcasts a signal 
of significant power at the other device’s receiver to either overload 
the receiving radio or mix with the subject’s transmitted signal to 
cause an interfered signal to be received. In-band interference

in the Unlicensed PCS band of which the (OEM System) Wireless system 
operates is prevented by the FCC rules requiring our equipment to 
monitor the carrier on which a device intends to transmit on before 
doing so, so as to sense any current use by another device. If such a 
signal is received during monitoring, we move to another carrier and 
try again. This protocol has been demonstrated many times within the 
FCC labs as well as at many industry trade shows where 5 or more 
vendors with U-PCS devices have operated in booths close to each other 
without interference. As for out-of-band interference, because of the 
extremely low power our devices operate with and the very strict outof-
band emission requirements placed upon the U-PCS devices, and the 
additional factor of a wide separation in the operating frequencies of 
our system and the typical radio telemetry equipment used in many 
hospital environments, such interference is very remote and would 
require extremely close proximity of the two devices. 

5) All of our (OEM Mdl Nr©) are FCC listed and has not 
interfered with other traffic within the same band. We expect the FCC 
listed (OEM Mdl Nr©) equipment will perform in the same manner. 

(b) Our Facility will work with (OEM) and VACO’s Spectrum 
Management (005OP2H3) to find a RF band that can be utilized for this 
operation that will allow VA to issue a formal and Official Radio Use 
Permit that will negate the “unregulated equipment use” issues. 

(4) CONNECTION TO IT/CABLE NETWORKS: 

(a) Each item or system that attaches to a VA IT Network 
(telephone or data) must be Department of Commerce’s National 
Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) Underwriters Laboratory (UL) 
60950-1/2; Information Technology Equipment - Safety listed and bears 
UL’s mark. 


 1) Paragraph 1.1.1; Equipment Covered by this Standard 
specifically identifies these systems / networks as one affected 
system. 

2) Paragraph 1.1.2; Additional Requirements further 
identifies this requirement for electomedical applications with 
physical connections to the patient be met. 

(b) This requirement is paramount since the Facility’s 
Telephone PABX and associated system is listed by the National Fire 
Protection Association as Critical Service. Additionally, since it 
carries our Code Blue Radio and Overhead Audio Paging Signals, VA 
elevates it to Life Safety Service. 

(c) Presently the (OEM Mdl Nr©) wireless phones are UL 
Listed but does not have the aforementioned specific UL certification. 
Our Facility is working with (The OEM) in this arena to have them meet 
or exceed this UL requirement. In the meantime we will abide within 
the confines outlined in the attached MOU for insuring an approved IT 
Network / System connection is maintained until the appropriate UL 
certification has been obtained allowing it to be directly connected 
to our telephone system. 

b. The Facility Director after careful review of the attached MOU 
and consultation with the Facility’s CIO, (OEM) engineers, Biomedical 
and NFPA Engineers, ISO, HIPAA / Privacy Officer, Clinical Staff and 
JACHAO Officials has decided this risk-benefit analysis strongly 
favors purchasing replacement (OEM Mdl Nr) phones.

each type of caisson placed and not on the length of individual 
caissons. When the total length of each type of completed caisson 
is greater or less than the length shown due to unsuitable soils or 
design modifications by the Resident Engineer, contract price 
adjustment will be made in accordance with Articles, DIFFERING SITE 
CONDITIONS, CHANGES and CHANGES-SUPPLEMENT of the GENERAL CONDITIONS 
as applicable. 

2. Contract price and time will be adjusted in accordance with 
Articles, DIFFERING SITE CONDITIONS, CHANGES and CHANGES-SUPPLEMENT

1.5 CLASSIFICATION OF EXCAVATION 

A. Soil/Weathered Rock Excavation: 

Soil or weathered rock that can be reasonably excavated with the rock 
auger, i.e. rock auger advancement greater than 150 mm (6 inches) per 
15 minutes (see rock auger refusal, 1.5.C-2, below) 

B. Sloping Weathered Rock Excavation: 

Excavation of soil/weathered rock that can typically be excavated with 
the rock auger, except when the steeply sloping orientation of the 
stratum causes the rock auger to run askew. 

C. Rock Excavation: 

1. Excavation of material that meets the rock auger refusal criteria 
and requires the rock core barrel or other hard rock excavation 
techniques for removal. 

2. Rock auger refusal is defined as a penetration rate of less than 150 
mm (6 inches) in 15 minutes, while operating a caisson drilling rig, 
rated with a torque capacity of at least 110 kN-meters (1,000,000 
inch-pounds), applying a continuous down pressure of at least 220 kN 
(50,000 pounds), equipped with a rock auger that contains conical 
carbide-tipped (“Kennemetal”) teeth. 

D. Nominal Soil or Weathered Rock Seams: 

 Nominal soil or weathered rock seams below rock auger refusal will be 
excavated and considered as rock for rock excavation quantities. A 
nominal soil or weathered rock seam is one which is less than 600 mm (2 
feet) thick. Where soil or weathered rock seams or voids of 600 mm (2 
feet) or greater are excavated within a mixed rock/soil or 
rock/weathered rock profile, excavation is classified as soil/weathered 
rock excavation until rock auger refusal is again established. 

1.6 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT FOR ROCK EXCAVATION 

A. Measurement: Excavation type in units of length shall be considered to 
change at the upper contact with a different excavation type as defined 
by section 1.5. 

B. Payment: Contract unit rates per length of each type of caisson shall 
be provided for each excavation condition type noted above in Section 
1.5. Contract price and time will be adjusted for overruns or 
underruns in accordance with Articles, DIFFERING SITE CONDITIONS, 
CHANGES and CHANGES-SUPPLEMENT of the GENERAL CONDITIONS as applicable. 

C. Payment for Differing Site Conditions: No payment will be made for any 
rock excavation beyond caisson limits unless additional excavation is 



directed by the Resident Engineer. When rock excavation, as 
classified, is encountered, contract price and time will be adjusted in 
accordance with Articles, DIFFERING SITE CONDITIONS, CHANGES and 
CHANGES-SUPPLEMENT of the GENERAL CONDITIONS as applicable.

work to the approval of the Engineer. 

4.0 SITE AND ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

4.1 Subsurface Information The subsurface information is provided only for 
information and guidance to the Contractor and shows the approximate nature 
of the strata as known to the Engineer. The Owner and Engineer shall not be 
liable for the accuracy of the data given and the Contractor may carry out 
his own subsurface investigation to obtain additional information. 

4.2 Site Visit The Contractor is advised to visit the site to acquaint 
himself with the site conditions and no claims for inadequate information 
regarding site conditions will be entertained at a later date. The system or 
systems put forward by the contractor shall be well known. The adequacy of 
any system and its approval shall be at the discretion of the Engineers. 

4.3 Underground Services And Adjacent Property The Contractor shall take 
care to ensure the safety of underground services and adjacent properties 
during the installation of micropiles. The contractor will be liable to any 
claims of damage due to the piling operations. 

5.0 DRILLING OPERATIONS 

5.1 Diameter of Piles The diameter of piles shall not be less than the 
specified/designed diameter at any level throughout its length. 

5.2 Drilling The Contractor shall submit to the Engineer details of 
drilling equipment and drilling procedure for approval before commencement of 
works. Drilling operations shall be carried out in accordance with the 
relevant requirements as follows: 

(a) Boring near recently Cast Piles Piles shall not be bored within three 
(3) diameters of other piles which have recently been cast less than 24 hours 
or contain unset grout, whichever longer to avoid damage to any of these 
piles. 

(b) Stability of Drill holes It is held that the Contractor has allowed in 
the unit rate of the pile for the implementation of all necessary measures, 
including the provision of all materials, labour and plant, for maintaining 
the stability of the sides of boreholes during micropile installation and 
successful completion of the piles. The Contractor shall submit his proposed 
methods for agreement prior to commencement of boring operations. 

 

Irrespective of the presence of groundwater, the sides of all boreholes shall 
be kept intact and no loose material shall be permitted to fall into the 
bottom of the boreholes. The Contractor's boring equipment shall be able to 


advance a steel casing to support the sides of all boring. If the sides of 
boreholes are found to be not stable, temporary steel casing shall be driven 
into stable stratum. The borehole shall be filled with drilling fluid to a 
level sufficiently to stabilize the boreholes. 

If groundwater is found in any hole in sufficient quantity or gushing out as 
to affect boring operations or excavations and removal of soil from the 
boreholes, or the sides of boreholes collapse, then a steel casing of 
appropriate size and length in conjunction with stabilizing fluid or other 
alternatives of sufficient strength shall be used to support the sides of the 
borehole and permit boring operations to proceed smoothly and safely. The 
proposed drilling fluid mix must be submitted to the Engineer for approval. 

Excavations shall not be exposed to the atmosphere longer than is necessary 
and shall be covered at all times when work is not in progress. Piles 
excavated shall be cast that same work day unless otherwise agreed by the 
Engineer. 

In the event of a rapid loss of drilling fluid from the borehole excavation 
and caused instability of bore, the excavation shall be backfilled without 
delay or other appropriate and approved remedial measures taken by the 
Contractor like installing temporary casing prior to resuming boring at that 
location. The cost of redrilling of the hole shall be borne by the 
Contractor. 

(c) Stability of bore by Temporary Casing Method 

Where the use of a temporary casing is required to maintain the stability of 
a bore, the bottom of casing shall be kept a minimum of 3 ft or more below 
the unstable strata to prevent the inflow of soil and the formation of 
cavities in the surrounding ground. 

Temporary casings shall be thin walled mild steel cylindrical casing. The 
dimensions and quality of the casing shall be adequate to withstand without 
damage or distortion all handling, construction and ground stresses to which 
they will be subjected. The casings shall have an internal diameter not less 
than the specified pile diameter. They shall be free of significant 
distortion, of uniform cross-section throughout each continuous length and 
free from internal projections and encrusted grout which might prevent the 
proper formation of piles. The joints of casings shall be watertight. 

If temporary casings are damaged during installation in a manner which 
prevents the proper formation of the pile, such casings shall be withdrawn 
from the bore before grout is placed, repaired if necessary, or other action 
taken as may be approved to continue the construction of the pile. 


. (d) Rock Coring Rock drilling will be required and will be a part of 
the work. There will be no additional compensation for drilling in hard 
rock. Coring of inclined rock surface, limestone pinnacles, cavities 
and soil below boulder/floater shall be considered as boring in soils. 
. (e) Inspection of Pile Excavation Where practicable, all pile 
excavations shall be inspected for their full length before grouting. 
The Contractor shall provide all the apparatus necessary for the 
inspection. In the course of inspection any loose or soft material in 
the borehole which is likely to affect the performance of the pile 
shall be removed to the satisfaction of the Engineer. 


6.0 GROUTING OPERATIONS 

6.1 Mixing and Placing Grout The Contractor shall provide details of the 
method and equipment used in grout mixing. Further information such as 
grouting pressure, grouting procedure, grouting equipment and technique 
employed in grouting underwater shall also be furnished for approval. 

Grout shall be mixed on site and shall be free from segregation, clumping and 
bleeding. Grout shall be pumped into its final position in one continuous 
operation as soon as possible and in no case more than half an hour after 
mixing. 

Micropile shall be grouted in one continuous process. If there is significant 
loss of grout, the Contractor may choose to carry out pre-grouting in stages 
as necessary to prevent further loss of grout for the construction of 
micropile. Method statement of pre-grouting including details of equipment, 
materials and procedures have to be reviewed and approved by the Engineer. If 
after the process of pre-grouting and re-drilling of the hole is required. 
The Contractor has to bear the cost and time of the pre-grouting and redrilling. 


6.2 Grout Falls 

The loss of flushing mediums of either water or drilling mud drilling will 
demonstrate potential for excessive grout loss or falls. Depending on its 
seriousness, the Contractor can decide to carry out a water tightness test to 
decide whether pregrouting is required. The cost and time of the test will be 
borne by the Contractor. Pregrouting and re-drilling shall be carried out if 
results of the test shown that leakage exceeds 1.3 gal per min at an excess 
head of 14.5 psi, measured over a period of 10 minutes. 

7.0 CONSTRUCTION OF PILE HEADS 

7.1 Lengthening of Piles Where lengthening is required, the pile 
reinforcement unit shall be connected on Site to the details shown on the 


Drawings. Other means of jointing reinforcement shall be to the approval of 
the Engineer. 

7.2 Cutting and Preparation of Pile Heads Pile heads shall be constructed 
to the details as shown on the Drawings. 

8.0 STANDARDS All materials shall be of the best quality and new. All 
piling work shall be executed in accordance with the approved designs 
prepared by the Contractor and to the approval of the Engineer. 

8.1 Standard Verification Test A verification test of two-and-one-half 
(2.5) times the working load shall be carried out on piles designated by the 
Engineers and in accordance with ASTM D 1143-81, Testing of Piles under Axial 
Compressive Load (Quick Procedure). The number and location of test piles 
shall be at the discretion of the Engineer. The Contractor shall submit a 
detailed proposal of the load tests to the Engineer and shall obtain his 
approval in writing before carrying them out. On completion of the test, the 
Contractor shall submit to the engineer the results including graphs showing 
load and settlement versus time and settlement versus load. The test 
procedure shall be as specified in Specification. Failure to standard load 
test shall be as specified in Specification. 

8.2 Proof-Testing Production proof-tests will be performed on at least 5 
percent of the production piles or no less than two (2) production piles. The 
maximum test load for production micropile proof-testing is (DL x 1.3). Proof 
tests shall be made by incrementally loading the micropile in accordance with 
the following schedule, to be used for both compression and tension loading.

The acceptance criteria for micropile verification load tests are: 

a. The pile shall sustain the compression and tension design loads (1.0 DL) 
with no more than 0.50 in. total vertical movement at the top of the pile as 
measured relative to the top of the pile prior to the start of testing. If an 


Alignment Load is used, then the allowable movement shall be reduced by 
multiplying by a factor of (DL-AL)/DL. (This conservatively accounts for the 
movement in reaching AL). 

b. At the end of the 1.33DL creep test load increment, test piles shall have 
a creep rate not exceeding 1mm per log cycle time (1 to 10 minutes) or 2mm 
per log cycle time (6 to 60 minutes). This creep rate shall be linear or 
decreasing throughout the creep load hold period. 

c. Failure does not occur at the 1.67DL maximum compression and tension 
loads. Failure is defined as the load at which attempts to further increase 
the test load simply result in continued pile movement. 

TEST REPORT 

The report shall contain the following: - 

A. Pile designation, date completed, weather condition, pile length, pile 
size, volume of 
B. grout intake, time of drilling at intervals not greater than 4m and

10.0 DAMAGED OR DISPLACED PILES 

Should the deviation exceed the tolerance provided in this specification, the 
contractor shall submit this remedial proposal for the approval for the 
Engineer. Failing this, the faulty pile shall be replaced by additional piles 
as necessary in positions as determined by the Engineer at no cost to 

the Owner. The cost of modification to pile cap etc., if any, shall be borne 
by the Contractor. The same will also apply to any piling work rejected by 
the Engineer for not truly constructed and installed in accordance with the 
specification. 

Where a pile has been damaged during installation, testing or by other 
causes, the damaged pile shall be considered and treated as a faulty pile and 
should be replaced by additional piles as approved by the Engineer at the 
Contractor's expense. 

10.1 Forcible Correction Not Permitted 


Where piles have not been positioned within the specified limits no method of 
forcible correction will be permitted. 

11.0 PAYMENT 

11.1 Unconcreted (Empty) Bore The unit rate of the pile shall be deemed to 
include whatever empty bore above the cut-off level of the pile and redrilling 
after pre-grouting. No claims will be considered for any empty bore 
and re- drilling, and the Contractor shall allow in Contract for the cost of 
these processes due to the sequence of construction. 

11.2 PAY LENGTH For all proposed pile, the Contractor shall be paid only 
for the length of installed pile measured from toe of the pile to the cut-off 
level. The same applies for the grout. Pregrouting, grout loss, over drill, 
re-drilling will have to be borne by the Contractor and shall be deemed to 
have included in the rate.

parallel to the direction in which the pavement is being laid from one 
side of the pavement to the other, and advancing not more than half the 
length of the float. 

B. After the longitudinal floating is completed, but while the concrete is 
still plastic, eliminate minor irregularities in the pavement surfaces 
by means of metal floats, 5 feet in length, and straightedges, 10 feet 
in length. Make the final finish with the straightedges, which shall be 
used to float the entire pavement surface.

nozzles of proper size and capacity as required for cleaning surfaces to 
be painted. The compressor shall furnish not less than 150 cfm of air at 
a pressure of not less than 90 psi at each nozzle used. 

PART 3 - EXECUTION 

3.1 SURFACE PREPARATION 

A. Allow new pavement surfaces to cure for a period of not less than 14 
days before application of marking materials. 

B. Thoroughly clean all surfaces to be marked before application of paint. 
Remove dust, dirt, and other granular surface deposits by sweeping, 
blowing with compressed air, rinsing with water, or a combination of 
these methods. Completely remove rubber deposits, existing paint 
markings, and other coatings adhering to the pavement with scrapers, 
wire brushings, sandblasting, mechanical abrasion, or approved chemicals 
as directed by the Resident Engineer. The application of paint 
conforming to Fed. Spec. TT-P-1952D is an option to removal of existing 
paint markings on asphalt pavement. Apply the black paint in as many 
coats as necessary to completely obliterate the existing markings. Where 
oil or grease are present on old pavements to be marked, scrub affected 
areas with several applications of trisodium phosphate solution or other 
approved detergent or degreaser, and rinse thoroughly after each 
application. After cleaning, seal oil-soaked areas with cut shellac to 
prevent bleeding through the new paint. Pavement marking shall follow as 


closely as practicable after the surface has been cleaned and dried, but 
do not begin any marking until the Resident Engineer has inspected the 
surface and gives permission to proceed. The Contractor shall establish 
control points for marking and provide templates to control paint 
application by type and color at necessary intervals. The Contractor is 
responsible to preserve and apply marking in conformance with the 
established control points. 

3.2 APPLICATION 

 Apply uniformly painted and reflective pavement marking of required 
color(s), length, and width with true, sharp edges and ends on properly 
cured, prepared, and dried surfaces in conformance with the details as 
shown and established control points. The length and width of lines 
shall conform within a tolerance of plus or minus 3 inches and plus or 
minus 1/8 inch, respectively, in the case of skip markings. The length 
of intervals shall not exceed the line length tolerance. Temperature of 
the surface to be painted and the atmosphere shall be above 50.F and 
less than 95.F. Apply the paint at a wet film thickness of 0.015 inch. 
Disperse reflective glass beads evenly on the wet paint at a rate of 6 
pounds per gallon of paint. Apply paint in one coat. At the direction of 
the Resident Engineer, markings showing light spots may receive 
additional coats. The maximum drying time requirements of the paint 
specifications will be strictly enforced, to prevent undue softening of 
asphalt, and pick-up, displacement, or discoloration by tires of 
traffic. If there is a deficiency in drying of the marking, discontinue 
paint operations until cause of the slow drying is determined and 
corrected. Remove and replace marking that is applied at less than 
minimum material rates; deviates from true alignment; exceeds stipulated 
length and width tolerances; or shows light spots, faulty distribution 
of beads, smears, or other deficiencies or irregularities. Use carefully 
controlled sand blasting, approved grinding equipment, or other approved 
method to remove marking so that the surface to which the marking was 
applied will not be damaged. 

3.3 PROTECTION 

 Conduct operations in such a manner that necessary traffic can move 
without hindrance. Protect the newly painted markings so that, insofar 
as possible, the tires of passing vehicles will not pick up paint. Place 
warning signs at the beginning of the wet line, and at points well in 
advance of the marking equipment for alerting approaching traffic from 
both directions. Place small flags or other similarly effective small 
objects near freshly applied markings at frequent intervals to reduce 


crossing by traffic. Efface and replace damaged portions of markings at 
no additional cost to the Government. 

3.4 DETAIL PAVEMENT MARKING 

 Use Detail Pavement Markings, exclusive of actual traffic lane marking, 
at exit and entrance islands and turnouts, on curbs, at crosswalks, at 
parking bays, and at such other locations as shown. Place detail 
pavement markings of the color(s), width(s) and length(s), and design 
pattern at the locations shown.

Commissioning Program Overview 

Goals and Objectives 

From Section 7.1 of the VA Whole Building Commissioning Process Manual 

“The objectives of the Commissioning Process in the Construction Phase of a project are as 
follows: 

a. Establish a Construction Phase Commissioning Team to work together collaboratively 
toward a common goal of delivering a functional high-performance facility on schedule 
and within budget. 
b. To verify system installation, contractor testing, and systems operations through rigorous 
testing and evaluation. 
c. Provide technical support for the construction team in resolving issues that affect 
systems installation, start-up, contractor testing, systems functional testing, or 
sustainable operations. 


General Project Information 

From the project solicitation Supplement B: 

“This project will create new space immediately adjacent to the Emergency Department to allow for 
expansion. The new area will increase the capacity of the Emergency department and increase its 
efficiency and throughput. The work will create (4) anti-ligature rooms, a sub-nurses’ station, family 
room, psychiatrist office, resident area, storage and work areas. 

 

Work also entails a remodel of the interior space to improve privacy, patient flow, and functionality 
of the space.” 

Systems to be Commissioned 

Division 21 

The new space requires the expansion of the existing fire protection system to cover this space. 
The system also requires minor alteration to cover renovations based on the remodel being 
installed in affected existing spaces. 

Commissioning efforts include verification of product submittal review, verification of installation 
according to specification and industry standards, witnessing of system testing, and verification 
of performance test reports being executed and delivered to the COR. 

Division 22 

The new space and renovated existing spaces require new plumbing fixtures and minor 
modifications to the service piping that serves each of these fixtures. The new roof has a new 


roof drain, new overflow drain and new roof leaders tied into the existing storm water removal 
system. 

 

Several of the spaces require medical gas service to be provided at disconnect stations. These 
systems include Medical Air, Oxygen, & Vacuum. These stations are served by the existing 
Hospital’s medical gas services. New Zone Valve Boxes, Pressure Gauges and Regulators are 
required in conformance with NFPA 99 and ASPE Volume 3 Chapter 2, “Plumbing Design for 
Health Care Facilities” as referenced in the VA Plumbing Design Manual. 

 

Commissioning efforts include verification of product submittal review, verification of installation 
according to specification and industry standards, witnessing of operational system testing,

delivered to the COR. 

Division 23 

The new space is being served by a new rooftop mounted Air Handling Unit. The renovated 
space is being served by the existing air handler. Each of these air handlers is served by central 
chilled water and steam systems. These systems include distribution systems with VAV terminal 
units, reheat coils (either hot water or electric) and DDC controls. Each distribution system 
requires leak testing, and upon acceptance, a complete system balance to ensure performance 
in terms of temperature, humidity and pressurization control. Each DDC is connected to the 
ECC and the EMCS, and the control system requires performance review at both the local and 
remote level. 

 

The Air Handling Units utilizes fan array technology with variable frequency drive on both the 
supply and exhaust sides. An air-to-air heat exchanger is utilized to capture energy from the 
exhaust stream to preheat the incoming outdoor air. Integrated damper controls modulate the 
incoming flows based on mixed air temperature conditions. 

 

Commissioning efforts include verification of product submittal review, verification of installation 
according to specification and industry standards, witnessing of operational system testing, 
witnessing of performance testing, witness of system integration testing and verification of all

Organization 

 

Communication Protocol 

The COR holds the contracts for the Commissioning Agent, the General Contractor, the A/E firm 
and facilitates the participation of the VA Facilities, Operations, Maintenance and User groups. 
All documentation shall be reviewed by the COR and upon approval be distributed to the entire 
Commissioning team. 

 

Coordination 

From Section 7.7 of the VA Whole Building Commissioning Process Manual: 

 

The objective of the commissioning process is to integrate commissioning tasks into the project 
construction schedule. The majority of commissioning activities should be completed as part of 
the normal construction schedule and finalized prior to the scheduled construction completion 
date. To this end, it is imperative that the Commissioning Agent and the contractor collaborate 
to integrate activities into the Contractor’s overall construction schedule. 

 

Responsibilities of the rest of the Commissioning team and tasks associated with such need to 
be planned for and executed accordingly to ensure negligible impact on the overall construction 
schedule. 

 

Meetings 

The commissioning agent will attend Construction Progress Meetings at the onset of each 
construction phase. This will be done to increase awareness of the construction progress and to 
review any outstanding commissioning issues that warrant attention by the Contractor or the 
COR. 

Commissioning Team Meetings will be held at the onset of each major commissioning task to 
review acceptance criteria associated with each task. These meetings will coincide with the 
scheduling of the construction meetings to assure attendance and will be included in the overall 
construction schedule to assure awareness. These meetings will be led by the commissioning 
agent and will cover commissioning tasks and activities. An agenda will be developed by the 
Commissioning Agent and will be distributed prior to the meeting by the COR to assist in 
preparing the Commissioning Team for the meeting. 

Management 

The Commissioning Agent will schedule a Kick-off meeting with the commissioning team to 
discuss tasks associated with commissioning the project, roles and responsibilities of each of 
the commissioning team members, document distribution and control for each of the 
construction stage phases, issues log and proposed resolutions and acceptance criteria 
associated with each system being commissioned. 

 

A spirit of collaboration is paramount to the successful commissioning of the project. 

 


[ End of Section ] 


Commissioning Communications Plan 

Document Control 

Development 

The Construction Commissioning plan will include the necessary documentation to guide the 
team to delivery and turnover of the project. The documents will include: 

• Meeting Agendas & associated minutes 
• Phase conclusion report and status to proceed to next phase 
• Copy of updated Construction Schedules 
• RFI and Submittal review and responses 
• Site Observation field reports 
• Issues log including documented issues, proposed resolution, and status of issue 
• Pre-functional Checklist and status 
• Systems Function Performance Test and status 
• “Lessons Learned” Documentation 
• Acceptance Phase Report 
• Training Criteria 
• Warranty visit conclusions 


Review 

Each Commissioning Meeting to be conducted will be coincidental with the Scheduled 
Construction meeting to encourage participation. The agenda will include progress report, 
upcoming tasks and activities, the current issues log, issues resolution discussions, and phase 
acceptance criteria. The construction schedule will be updated accordingly. 

Distribution 

Commissioning documentation will first be issued to the COR for review and approval prior to 
being distributed to the team to ensure that there are no conflicts in terms of contractual 
obligations and for clarity of information being disseminated. 

Issue Resolution 

Issue Log 

The primary focus of commissioning a project is to report on progress to ensure that tasks are 
being completed according to the accepted standards of the VA. The commissioning agent from 
time to time will take note of deviations from accepted practice and/or the contract documents. 
These issues will be presented in the issue log and issued to the COR for review. The COR will 
either accept the deviation or will request resolution from the Construction team. 


Recommendations for Issue Resolution 

It is important to remember the Commissioning Agent’s responsibility to ensure tasks and 
activities are completed in a manner that will deliver an acceptable project. This is done by 
reporting deviations in respect to contract documents and industry standards. Upon receiving a 
request for resolution from the COR, the Commissioning agent and all affected parties will 
coordinate and the responsible party will present potential resolutions. 

Directives for Issue Resolution and Contract Changes 

The COR is the authority when it comes to accepting the deviation resolution. The COR will 
issue the directive to the responsible party in terms of what resolution has been accepted, and 
the criteria at which the execution of the resolution will close the issue. The issues log will be 
updated to reflect the status of the issue. 

Should the issue brought forth constitute a change to the contractual obligations of the 
responsible party, that discussion and resolution will take place between the COR and the 
responsible party. Upon agreement, the contractual changes will be presented to the team, and 
the appropriate documents and construction schedule will be updated to reflect the change. 

[ End of Section ] 

 


Client Facility Requirements 

VA Project Requirements (OPR) 

The COR and the design team worked together during the programming phase of the project to 
develop the VA Project Requirements (OPR) documentation. This documentation needs to be 
distributed to the Commissioning Team to enhance the understanding of what the VA’s needs 
were, and how the project deliverables were developed in order to satisfy those needs. 

Design Narrative (BOD) 

The A/E design team developed design narratives which compiled comprises of the Basis of 
Design (BOD) documents. This documentation needs to be distributed to the commissioning 
team to enhance the understanding of the project deliverables, the design decisions, the 
construction scope and the overall intent of the project. 

Client Facility Requirements Matrix (CFR) 

The OPR and the BOD will be utilized by the Commissioning Agent to develop the Client Facility 
Requirements (CFR) Matrix. This document will be utilized to enhance the Construction and 
Commissioning teams understanding of the performance criteria associated with each of the 
spaces being constructed/renovated and the acceptance of each one of the systems serving 
them. 

[ End of Section ] 


Pre-Functional Checklists 

Requests for Information 

The RFI log will be kept up to date by the Contractor. The commissioning agent will conduct a 
periodic view of the log to monitor progress in terms of resolution. Items that may affect the 
commissioning of certain systems will be noted in the issues log and updated accordingly. 

Submittal Reviews 

Submittals for Divisions 21, 22, 23, 26, 27 and 28 will be reviewed by the Commissioning Agent. 
Focus will be on equipment, distribution and controls. Deviations along with recommendations 
from the A/E team will be reflected in the Issues Log, and the Pre-Functional Checklist and 
System Functional Performance Testing documents will be updated as required. 

Installation Observations 

Periodic site observations will be conducted by the Commissioning Agent during this phase of 
the Construction Stage. Field reports will be generated, noting progress and any deviations from 
industry standards and the project specifications. Deviations will be reported in the Issues Log, 
and will be reviewed by the COR to determine path for resolution. 

Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) Witnessing 

Equipment requiring FAT testing is required to be witnessed by the Commissioning Agent. The 
Contractor is required to keep the Commissioning Agent informed on the Procurement Progress 
of said equipment and shall inform the Commissioning Agent and the COR of when such testing 
is scheduled to be conducted, so they can plan accordingly. A copy of the performance test, 
passing the criteria shall be issued to the Commissioning Agent so it can be included in the 
Commissioning Report. 

 [ End of Section ] 


Systems Functional Performance Test 

Operational Verification 

Components of the systems for Divisions 21, 22, 23, 26, 27 & 28 require individual operation 
testing. Reports of these tests along with the performance parameters shall be issued to the 
Commissioning Agent proving each component is working acceptably across its acceptable 
range. A complete set of reports is required to be received and accepted by the Commissioning 
Agent prior to proceeding to the Performance Verification phase. 

Performance Verification 

Once all the components have been checked out, and all the controls have been actuated, the 
system performance can now be verified. Performance verification will be witnessed by the 
Commissioning Agent. The system will be run through the Systems Functional Performance 
Test Procedure. Upon acceptance of the Performance Test, a report will be prepared by the 
Commissioning Agent stating the system is ready for integration. 

Systems Integration 

After all Division 21, 22, 23, 26, 27 and 28 systems have passed the Performance Test Criteria, 
the Systems will be ready for the Integration Phase. The spaces will each be checked in terms 
of each division. Space performance criteria will include pressurization, temperature and 
humidity control, power and lighting operation and control, low voltage system connectivity, and 
fire sprinkler/fire alarm responses. 

 

The systems will be tested at the local control level and remotely at the ECC and/or EMCS as 
applicable with the contract documents.

System Manual 

 

Upon completion of resolution of any reported deviations, along with acceptance of the System 
Performance Functional Testing phase, the project shall be deemed “Substantially Complete”. 
Each system from Division 21, 22, 23, 26, 27 & 28 that underwent the full commissioning 
process will have a manual put together by the Commissioning Agent comprised of the 
submittal documents for the components along with the testing data for operations and 
performance of each system. 

 

As-Built documentation should be completed by these time and issued to the A/E or other entity 
contracted to produce record drawings for the project scope. Upon completion of the Record 
Drawings, applicable documents shall be included for each system. 

 

These documents will be compiled and issued to the COR to comprise the “Systems Manual” 
for the project.

Acceptance Phase 

 

Final Construction Walk Through 

A final punchlist will be generated by the A/E team, the VA Team, the COR and the 
commissioning team that should comprise small items that need to be corrected prior to 
turnover of the project. Included should be any items from the Issues log that still require 
resolution. The Commissioning Agent will verify that all outstanding items have been 
corrected and will issue an acceptance report. 

Operations & Maintenance Manuals 

Operations and Maintenance Manuals are required to be provided to the A/E or other 
contracted entity for review and approval. Upon acceptance by the COR and the 
Commissioning agent. 

 

The Commissioning Agent will also ensure that the Systems Manual has been completed 
and is ready for turnover to the VA. 

Lessons Learned 

Prior to signing off on the project for “Final Completion” the Commissioning Agent will 
conduct one last meeting with the Commissioning Team. The goals of this meeting is to 
identify tasks and activities that went well, challenges that occurred during delivery of the 
project, and opportunities for all teams to improve performance in their due respects in the 
future. 

 

Also in this meeting, tasks and activities left to be scheduled and conducted in the warranty 
phase are training and the 11 month walk-through. A specific list of systems and 
components to be trained on will be reviewed and the training sessions along with required 
participants will be scheduled. 

 

At the conclusion of this meeting, the project shall be deemed complete and closed out.

Training Requirements 

 

Certain systems have been specified to include training. The training shall be conducted over 
the durations as listed in the specifications. Participants shall report their attendance and the 
proctor of each training session shall issue their agenda, their training program, and attendee 
list for review by the COR and the Commissioning Agent.

Warranty Phase 

 

At approximately 11 months after the turnover of the project, the entire commissioning team 
shall walk through the project scope and observe the performance of the spaces and 
systems. Any deviations need to be reported at this time for the contractor to fix prior to the 
workmanship warranty period to expire. 

 

The contractor shall resolve any outstanding issues contractually obligated in accordance 
with Directives by the COR. Final acceptance of the project upon completion of the 
resolutions brought forth shall conclude the warranty phase of the project.
